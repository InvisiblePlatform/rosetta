It uses a high proportion of eco-friendly materials including <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=gots>Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)</a> cotton. There is no evidence it minimises textile waste. There is no evidence it is taking specific steps to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. However its use of eco-friendly materials reduces its climate impact and limits the amount of chemicals, water and wastewater used in production. </p><p>Its labour rating is 'good'. Most of its facilities are <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=ft-usa>Fair Trade USA</a> certified. There is no evidence it has a Code of Conduct but it has a formal statement covering workers rights. It sources its final stage of production from countries with extreme risk of labour abuse. It traces most of its supply chain including all of the final stage of production. It ensures payment of a living wage in some of its supply chain. </p><p>Its animal rating is 'it's a start'. There is no evidence it has an animal welfare policy. It does not use fur, leather, down, exotic animal skin, exotic animal hair or angora.
