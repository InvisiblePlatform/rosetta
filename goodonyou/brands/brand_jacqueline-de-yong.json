It uses some eco-friendly materials including organic cotton. There is no evidence it minimises textile waste when manufacturing its products. It has set a science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated from its own operations and supply chain but there is no evidence it is on track to meet its target. There is no evidence it implements water reduction initiatives in most of its supply chain. </p><p>Its labour rating is 'not good enough'. Little of its supply chain is certified by labour standards which ensure worker health and safety, living wages or other labour rights. It received a score of 21-30% in the <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=fti>Fashion Transparency Index</a>. It likely publishes detailed information about its supplier policies, audits and remediation processes. It does not publish a list of suppliers or information about forced labour, gender equality or freedom of association. There is no evidence it ensures payment of a living wage in its supply chain. It discloses partial policies and safeguards to protect suppliers and workers in its supply chain from the impacts of COVID-19. </p><p>Its animal rating is 'good'. It has a basic formal policy to protect animal welfare. It states that it sources wool from non-mulesed sheep. It does not use fur, leather, exotic animal hair, down, exotic animal skin or angora.
