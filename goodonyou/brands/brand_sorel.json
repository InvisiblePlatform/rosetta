Around 60% of its textiles are sourced from <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=bluesign>Bluesign</a> certified mills. The majority of its range uses non eco-friendly materials but it is starting to use more recycled polyester. It is taking steps to implement a strategy to reduce waste in its manufacturing and operations parts of its supply chain. It measures and reports on its direct and indirect emissions, but only for its North American operations which excludes most of its manufacturing. It has made a public commitment to reduce its direct and indirect carbon emissions but has not yet set a clear time bound carbon reduction target. It has made no commitment to eliminate hazardous chemicals, but it complies with a Restricted Substances List. 95% of its leather is sourced from <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=lwg>Leather Working Group</a> accredited tanneries, but it does not state their level of certification. It has no water reduction initiatives or policies. It measures and reports on water usage and wastewater management, but only for facilities which it owns. It is a member of the <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=sac>Sustainable Apparel Coalition</a>.</p><p>Its labor rating is 'it's a start'. It has a robust Supplier Code of Conduct based on the <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=fla>FLA Workplace Code of Conduct</a> Workplace Code of Conduct. It sources from countries with high or extreme risk of labor abuse but attempts to address those risks through affiliation with the <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=fla>FLA Workplace Code of Conduct</a> and <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=uzbek>Uzbek Cotton Pledge</a>. It mentions paying a living wage and supplies an adequate definition, however it does not assure its payment. It traces suppliers in its manufacturing and material inputs parts of its supply chain and it has publicly shared a list of suppliers, but it is unclear whether this is complete or not. It audits some of its supply chain once a year by third party or internal auditors that are accredited in social auditing and all of its audits are unannounced.</p><p>Its animal rating is 'it's a start'. It uses animal fur, leather and shearling from unspecified sources. It uses down feather, but 100% of this is accredited by the <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=rds>Responsible Down Standard</a> and it uses wool from non-mulesed sheep. It does not use angora or exotic animal hair or skin.</p><p>Sorel is rated 'It's a start' based on information from our own research.</p>","labourRating":13.1,"labourLabel":"It's a start","lastRated":"March 2017","environmentRating":11,"environmentLabel":"Not good enough","animalRating":12.5,"animalLabel":"It's a start","positiveText":"Dear Sorel, I love the style and features of your products, and also that you care about people, the planet and animals.
