It does not use eco-friendly materials but it recycles some off-cuts created during the manufacturing process. It measures and reports on its direct and indirect emissions but does not do so for its entire supply chain and it does not use any widely accepted tools to guide measurement and reporting on its carbon emissions. It has made a public commitment to reduce its carbon emissions by 40% by the year 2020 and it has taken meaningful action on meeting its carbon reduction target. It complies with a Restricted Substances List however it has made no commitment to eliminate hazardous chemicals from its supply chain. It measures and reports on water usage and wastewater management and publicly reports on targets. </p> <p>Its labour rating is 'good' based on the 2017 Ethical Fashion Report. This looks at criteria including payment of a living wage, transparency and worker empowerment. It received the top score for its Supplier Code of Conduct included in its supplier contracts. It also traces most of its supply chain including all of its final stage, most of its inputs and some or none of its raw material stages. It publicly lists some of its suppliers and it ensures that no subcontracting occurs or that all subcontracted production adheres to code standards. It audits most of its traced facilities over a two-year period across its entire supply chain however it has very few worker empowerment initiatives. It received a good score in relation to implementing a living wage or improving wages across its supply chain. </p> <p>This brand does not use any animal derived materials. Since the brand makes products that are generally free of animal materials, we haven't awarded points. The total score is calculated from environment and labour scores only. </p> <p>Playtex is rated 'It's a start' based on information from the 2017 Ethical Fashion Report and our own research.</p><p><i>Last Updated: March 2017</i></p>","labourRating":15,"labourLabel":"Good","environmentRating":12,"environmentLabel":"It's a start","animalRating":0.02,"animalLabel":"Not applicable","questionsCount":2,"positiveText":"Dear Playtex, I love the style and features of your products, and also that you care about people, the planet and animals.
