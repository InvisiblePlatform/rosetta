It likely publishes detailed information about its supplier policies, audits and remediation processes. It publishes a detailed list of suppliers in the final stage of production and some information about the findings of supplier audits. It publishes some information about forced labour, gender equality or freedom of association. There is no evidence it ensures payment of a living wage in most of its supply chain.
