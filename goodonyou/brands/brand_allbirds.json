It uses a medium proportion of eco-friendly materials including Tencel Lyocell. It has a general statement on eliminating hazardous chemicals but has not set a time-bound target.

There is no evidence it has worker empowerment initiatives such as collective bargaining or rights to make a complaint. It has a Code of Conduct that covers all of the <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=ilo>ILO Four Fundamental Freedoms</a> principles. It sources its final stage of production from countries with extreme risk of labour abuse. There is no evidence it ensures payment of a living wage in its supply chain. It discloses inadequate policies and safeguards to protect suppliers and workers in its supply chain from the impacts of COVID-19. </p><p>Its animal rating is 'good'. It has a general statement about minimising animal suffering but not a formal animal welfare policy. It uses wool certified by the ZQ Merino label. It does not use leather, down fur, exotic animal skin, exotic animal hair or angora. It traces all animal products to the first stage of production.
