It uses some eco-friendly materials including recycled materials. It has set a science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated from its own operations and supply chain but it is unclear whether it is on track to meet its target. There is no evidence it has taken meaningful action to reduce or eliminate hazardous chemicals. There is no evidence it implements water reduction initiatives.</p><p>Its labour rating is 'not good enough'. None of its supply chain is certified by labour standards which ensure worker health and safety, living wages or other labour rights. It received a score of 41-50% in the 2021 <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=fti>Fashion Transparency Index</a>. There is no evidence it implements practices to support diversity and inclusion in its supply chain. There is no evidence it ensures payment of a living wage in its supply chain. It discloses some policies to protect suppliers and workers in its supply chain from the impacts of COVID-19. It has been linked with sourcing cotton from the Xinjiang region in China at risk of using Uyghur forced labour and has taken insufficient steps to remediate.</p><p>Its animal rating is 'it's a start'. There is no evidence it has a policy to minimise the suffering of animals. It uses exotic animal hair and wool. It uses down accredited by the <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=rds>Responsible Down Standard</a>. It does not use fur, angora, leather or exotic animal skin.
