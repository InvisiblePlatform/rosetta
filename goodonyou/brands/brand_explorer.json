It traces all or almost all of its supply chain including final stage, inputs and raw materials. It publicly lists all or a portion of its suppliers along with their addresses and it ensures that no subcontracting occurs or that all subcontracted production adheres to code standards. It audits most of its traced facilities over a two-year period across its entire supply chain. It has very few worker empowerment initiatives, but is making progress towards paying a living wage across some of its supply chain. It has signed the <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=bbfsa>Bangladesh Building and Fire Safety Accord</a>, is a member of the <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=eti>Ethical Trading Initiative - ETI</a> and has pledged to not knowingly source Uzbek cotton for the manufacturing of any of its products. </p> <p>Its animal rating is 'it's a start'.
