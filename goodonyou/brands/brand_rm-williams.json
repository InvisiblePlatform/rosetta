Williams does not communicate sufficient information about its environmental policies","ethicalInfo2":"<p>R.M. Williams is owned by LVMH.</p> <p>Its environment rating is 'not good enough'. It does not use eco-friendly materials but it creates high-quality, long-lasting products and has a repair and reuse program in place. It does not have adequate policies on energy use and carbon emissions. There is no evidence it is taking adequate steps to minimise or eliminate hazardous chemicals in its supply chain including the environmental pollution of chromium and other chemicals from leather tanning processes. There is also no evidence it has adequate policies or initiatives on water usage and wastewater management. </p> <p>Its labour rating is 'good' based on the 2017 Ethical Fashion Report. This looks at criteria including payment of a living wage, transparency and worker empowerment. It received the top score for its Supplier Code of Conduct included in its supplier contracts. It traces its final and input stages of its supply chain. It does not publicly list all of its suppliers but it ensures that none or only a small amount of subcontracting occurs. It audits all of its traced final stage facilities over a two-year period but does not do so for its entire input stage. It has some worker empowerment initiatives across parts of its supply chain. It has made minimal progress towards ensuring payment of a living wage across its supply chain. </p> <p>Its animal rating is 'not good enough'. It uses leather and wool without stating its sources. It also uses fur and exotic animal skins such as crocodile and exotic animal hair such as cashmere. It does not use down or angora. </p> <p>R.M.
