It does not use eco-friendly materials but it creates high-quality, long-lasting products and it is taking steps to reduce waste in its direct operations. It measures and reports on its direct and indirect emissions but does not do so for its entire supply chain and it has made no commitment to reduce its direct and indirect carbon emissions but it has set a target to reduce its energy intensity. There is no evidence it is taking adequate steps to minimise or eliminate hazardous chemicals in its supply chain or has adequate policies or initiatives on water usage and wastewater management. </p> <p>Its labour rating is not good enough' based on the 2017 Ethical Fashion Report. This looks at criteria including payment of a living wage, transparency and worker empowerment. It received the top score for its Supplier Code of Conduct included in its supplier contracts. It traces some of its supply chain including final stage, inputs and raw materials. It likely does not publicly list its suppliers but it does ensure that none or only a small amount of subcontracting occurs. It audits only a small portion of its traced facilities over a two-year period across its supply chain. It has minimal worker empowerment initiatives and has made little to no progress towards paying a living wage across its supply chain. </p> <p>Its animal rating is it's a start'. It uses wool and leather without stating its sources. It does not use fur, angora, down or exotic animal skin or hair.
