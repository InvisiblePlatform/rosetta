None of its supply chain is certified by labour standards which ensure worker health and safety, living wages or other labour rights. It received a score of 41-50% in the <a href=goodonyou://glossary?slug=fti>Fashion Transparency Index</a>. It likely publishes information about its supplier policies, audits and remediation processes. It publishes a detailed list of suppliers in the final stage of production and some information about the second stage of production.
