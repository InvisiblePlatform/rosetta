There is no evidence it minimises textile waste when manufacturing its products. </p><p>Its labour rating is 'not good enough'.

It does not disclose adequate policies or safeguards to protect suppliers and workers in its supply chain from the impacts of COVID-19.</p><p>Its animal rating is 'not good enough'.
