To do this, PUR Projet helps these businesses to regenerate, revitalize and preserve the ecosystems upon which they depend. This approach is called \"Insetting.\" PUR Projet designs integrated Insetting programs and projects that incorporate social, economic and environmental compliance and innovation into all types of supply chains, from the farm to final consumer. The objective is to reduce risks and encourage well-managed supply chains. They then work on additional initiatives to strengthen the communities within which we work. Trees and agroforestry are at the heart of PUR Projet activities, as they provide unrivalled ecosystem service benefits.
