We partner with skilled local solar installers, community organizations, businesses and investors to develop, finance and manage solar projects that deliver clean power, energy savings and green jobs to underserved solar markets. \n\nWe democratize solar investment – attracting capital from a new group of solar investors, including individuals, family offices, foundations and corporations who recognize the value of building a more inclusive solar economy and want to put their money to work directly in projects that benefit people and the planet.\n\nSunwealth is a Public Benefit Corporation located in Cambridge, MA. Since 2014, we have invested over $65 million in more than 465 community-based solar projects across 13 states and the District of Columbia. These projects have created over $50 million in revenues for local solar developers and installers, and will deliver over $0.50 in lifetime savings for every dollar invested.
