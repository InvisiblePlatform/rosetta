Work with mates who truly get a kick out of your success. They’ve got your back no matter what the goal or the industry.\n\nLet’s back it up to a few years ago when a couple of mates put their heads together and came up with a pretty good idea. Actually, a bloody great idea. They wanted to provide an easy, fast, affordable accounting and business advisory service run by fully qualified CPAs, where the clients were treated like friends and not numbers.\n\nThey stripped back an over-priced, over-complicated industry and turned it into an efficient business where conversation and getting to know people is priority, and the numbers come second. Work gets done, new mates are found and the Friday arvo beers are poured. Oh and they are also highly qualified, very experienced professionals. Professionals?

They believe that architecture is an important tool in the creation of community, the way they interact with and create places, and the way people engage with each other. Dunn & Hillam Architects follow three basic principles in everything they do.\n \nIt's the people that matter: Great clients, great staff, great consultants and collaborators make great projects. Architecture is for people and should benefit those inside it and those around it.\n \nGood design is sustainable design: A building doesn’t have to flag itself as sustainable. Dunn & Hillam believe in building smaller but better as the most important move towards sustainable architecture. Sustainability is always in environmental, economic and social terms.\n \nArchitecture is not a consumer object: Architecture should not become obsolete or out of fashion. It should work with the past and with the future to contribute to our cities, towns and landscapes in ways that are lasting and positive. Architecture is spatial and three dimensional and its success is based more on how it makes you feel than on how it looks.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Architecture design &

being distinguishably Australian. They believe that architecture is an important tool in the creation of community, the way they interact with and create places, and the way people engage with each other. Dunn & Hillam Architects follow three basic principles in everything they do.\n \nIt's the people that matter: Great clients, great staff, great consultants and collaborators make great projects. Architecture is for people and should benefit those inside it and those around it.\n \nGood design is sustainable design: A building doesn’t have to flag itself as sustainable. Dunn & Hillam believe in building smaller but better as the most important move towards sustainable architecture. Sustainability is always in environmental, economic and social terms.\n \nArchitecture is not a consumer object: Architecture should not become obsolete or out of fashion. It should work with the past and with the future to contribute to our cities, towns and landscapes in ways that are lasting and positive. Architecture is spatial and three dimensional and its success is based more on how it makes you feel than on how it looks.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Architecture design & planning","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"2018","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1465344000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"85.7","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New South Wales","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Rosebery","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"2018","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"New South Wales","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Botany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Rosebery","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"5f17582f-4257-5c19-b676-ef2bd65f48fc","name":"Grow Good","slug":"grow-good","description":"Grow Good is all about helping you go B Corp & beyond. \n\nB Corp #8 in New Zealand, we have played an instrumental role in forming and expanding the B Corp community in Aotearoa New Zealand.\n\nWe specialise in helping teams navigate the B Corp Impact Assessment.
