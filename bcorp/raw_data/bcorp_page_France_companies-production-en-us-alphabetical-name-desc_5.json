Son écosystème autonome, pérenne et sain, a motivé dès 2008 l’adoption du modèle de l’agroécologie s’inspirant de la toute proche forêt de Rambouillet\n\nLa Ferme de la Tremblaye maîtrise désormais l’ensemble des étapes de la production de ses fromages fermiers, depuis la culture de fourrages en Agriculture Biologique jusqu’à l’affinage, en passant par l’élevage des bêtes, la fabrication des fromages à partir du lait de la ferme. Elle prend en compte également la protection et l’entretien des sols, de la forêt, ou encore la production de sa propre énergie et le recyclage des déchets de l’exploitation par le biais d’un méthaniseur.\n\nSince 1967, the Ferme de la Tremblaye has been offering farm cheeses from cow and goat.

Ce modèle s’inscrit dans les objectifs 2030 de l’ONU et ambitionne d’impacter positivement 1 million de personnes d’ici 2025. \n\nLe projet Chacun Son Café a été créé en 2005 dans un contexte où la seule façon connue pour faire un bon café à la maison est la capsule. Son ambition : être une alternative militante à la capsule notamment pour ce qu’elle représente, en offrant un autre paradigme face à l'industrialisation de notre alimentation. Chacun Son Café est depuis lors le chef de file du mouvement anti-capsule, incarné par le hashtag #IAmACapsuleKiller. \n\nChacun Son Café adresse à la fois le particulier et les entreprises pour la consommation du café au bureau, en valorisant les cultures et les traditions de préparations face à l’uniformisation de nos gestes dans notre rituel, la diversité des saveurs et la mise en valeur de l’arôme dans notre expérience sensorielle face à la standardisation des goûts.

They use Spark to attract, retain and engage today’s workers by connecting people personally to causes that matter to them. With more than 2 million users around the world, Benevity will process donations benefitting more than 100,000 global charities this year. As a certified B Corporation, Benevity joins a new breed of for-profit companies with a social mission who are setting the standard for doing well by doing good.\n\nBenevity hopes to use their technology through multiple integrations to make giving to the charity of one’s choice as convenient and prevalent as leaving a tip at a restaurant. Benevity envisions a reshaping of the notion and execution of personal and corporate philanthropy that sees it embedded into a variety of everyday consumptive and commercial activities. In such a landscape, people from all demographics – regardless of their means – can give money, time, goods, etc. to the social causes of their choice, while corporations better utilize their resources and influence to do the same in a virtuous circle.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Computer programming services","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental

They use Spark to attract, retain and engage today’s workers by connecting people personally to causes that matter to them. With more than 2 million users around the world, Benevity will process donations benefitting more than 100,000 global charities this year. As a certified B Corporation, Benevity joins a new breed of for-profit companies with a social mission who are setting the standard for doing well by doing good.\n\nBenevity hopes to use their technology through multiple integrations to make giving to the charity of one’s choice as convenient and prevalent as leaving a tip at a restaurant. Benevity envisions a reshaping of the notion and execution of personal and corporate philanthropy that sees it embedded into a variety of everyday consumptive and commercial activities. In such a landscape, people from all demographics – regardless of their means – can give money, time, goods, etc. to the social causes of their choice, while corporations better utilize their resources and influence to do the same in a virtuous circle.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Computer programming services","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"T2E 2W5","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"workplace giving, philanthropy, matching, employee giving, employee volunteering, tracking, volunteers, grants, non profits, software","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"India","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ireland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Italy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Spain","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1306800000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"112.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Alberta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Calgary","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"T2E 2W5","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Alberta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Calgary","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"a9d99c19-5636-588a-b135-dfbb01c4dbaa","name":"Beeye","slug":"beeye","description":"Clients, missions, tasks, planning, profitability: find everything in one place.
