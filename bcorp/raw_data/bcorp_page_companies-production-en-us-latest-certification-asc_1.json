In contrast, HCA provides its home health aides with full-time hours, and employees also receive: health insurance; dental insurance; transit passes; paid time-off; life insurance; worker-ownership opportunities; case management; and other supportive services. These practices promote retention for HCA’s workforce and ensure continuity of care for clients. HCA provides competitive wages, and its employees receive regular raises.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Home health care","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"19102","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"health care hospital corporation america home healthcare \"social work\" philadelphia philly pennsylvania doctor nurse medical assistance human services homecare associates association, HCA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1349654400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"150.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Pennsylvania","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Philadelphia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"19102","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"PA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Pennsylvania","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Philadelphia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"8c804ffa-3836-5942-929e-3b9e64c38737","name":"Estudios y Consultorias Focus","slug":"estudios-y-consultorías-focus","description":"focus is a research and consulting firm based in Santiago, Chile that specializes in public policies, investigation, program planning, assessment, design and implementation and advisory in social development matters in both the private and public sectors. focus' expertise covers a variety of topics such as education, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and community link, childhood in vulnerable conditions, family strengthening, human environment, local and territorial development and social development.\n\n Focus intends to develop and strengthen innovative, relevant, efficient and effective social policies and programs that will impact people and the society, especially the most vulnerable ones.

concentrates on brownfield sites instead of unexplored area. The urban areas have enormous potential to transform themselves into sustainable communities. B Corp certification gives us an objective assessment of the actual realization of Re-Vive's beliefs and a tool to prove they makes things happen. It is also a way to reset the standards in a rather conservative business such as real estate development. The B-corp label gives Re-Vive a boost to outperform on their impact ambitions.\n \n The mission of Re-Vive in these areas is to develop green spaces and living quarters with a social, demographic and functional mix. Through all projects Re-Vive stimulates neighbourhood participation , the use of public transport and biodiversity. Recycling of demolition materials, the reuse of rainwater, reducing waste and the use of sustainable materials are always included in the project plans. Historically, the legacy problems of such sites have stood in the way of redevelopment with the barrier of reclaiming contaminated sites and regenerating existing buildings proving too complex to resolve. The net result is these sites largely remain undeveloped.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Real estate development","sector":"Service with Significant Environmental

The urban areas have enormous potential to transform themselves into sustainable communities. B Corp certification gives us an objective assessment of the actual realization of Re-Vive's beliefs and a tool to prove they makes things happen. It is also a way to reset the standards in a rather conservative business such as real estate development. The B-corp label gives Re-Vive a boost to outperform on their impact ambitions.\n \n The mission of Re-Vive in these areas is to develop green spaces and living quarters with a social, demographic and functional mix. Through all projects Re-Vive stimulates neighbourhood participation , the use of public transport and biodiversity. Recycling of demolition materials, the reuse of rainwater, reducing waste and the use of sustainable materials are always included in the project plans. Historically, the legacy problems of such sites have stood in the way of redevelopment with the barrier of reclaiming contaminated sites and regenerating existing buildings proving too complex to resolve. The net result is these sites largely remain undeveloped.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Real estate development","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Significant Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Belgium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"9000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"revive re vive real estate development commercial residential brown brownfield regeneration sustainable green revitalize revitalizing urban inner city building transform Sustainability Development Brownfield Real estate Passive Low-energy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Belgium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Poland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1355184000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"104.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Belgium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Ghent","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Ghent","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"9000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Ghent","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"not listed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Ghent","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"f2515aa6-32f3-5e25-83e1-534e68fd2c02","name":"PlanoCDE","slug":"planocde","description":"Plano CDE helps identify opportunities, strategies and consumer insight on targets through market research, consultancy and training.

These stories are beautiful, singular and unexpected, having roots that travel much deeper than the mere circumstance of how two people met and fell in love. The jewelry that we give one another, the symbols of our unique love, isn’t just conjured from the ether. Most gems are dug out of the ground, and usually it’s a rather messy and ugly business that comes at great peril for the individuals doing the mining and for the environment. For this reason FTJCo believe it’s essential that every step a ring makes on its journey to you is accounted for.\n \nAll Fairtrade and Fairmined gold comes from small-scale and artisanal mines that take great pains to reduce their dependence on harmful chemicals. This is good news for the environment and for the people who live and mine in these communities. It’s not overstating things in the least to say that this gold changes the lives of those who mine it, and at FTJCo they want to make sure it’s for the better, not the worse.","market":"Developed -

These stories are beautiful, singular and unexpected, having roots that travel much deeper than the mere circumstance of how two people met and fell in love. The jewelry that we give one another, the symbols of our unique love, isn’t just conjured from the ether. Most gems are dug out of the ground, and usually it’s a rather messy and ugly business that comes at great peril for the individuals doing the mining and for the environment. For this reason FTJCo believe it’s essential that every step a ring makes on its journey to you is accounted for.\n \nAll Fairtrade and Fairmined gold comes from small-scale and artisanal mines that take great pains to reduce their dependence on harmful chemicals. This is good news for the environment and for the people who live and mine in these communities. It’s not overstating things in the least to say that this gold changes the lives of those who mine it, and at FTJCo they want to make sure it’s for the better, not the worse.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Jewelry & related articles","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"M4X1P3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1363305600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"91.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Ontario","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Toronto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"M4X1P3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Ontario","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Toronto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"08ec0578-83d8-599e-a413-8fae5363ddba","name":"Animal Experience International","slug":"animal-experience-international","description":"Animal Experience International (AEI) is an organization with a mission to help animals around the globe by matching clients with animal-related volunteer opportunities at sanctuaries, wildlife hospitals, animal clinics and conservation projects.

The company has ranked in the Inc. 500/5000 roster of AmericaÕs fastest-growing companies for three consecutive years. Savvy RestÕs founder, Michael Penny, took an unusual path to business. He lived for 20 years in a yoga ashram, consuming little and owning less. After leaving that community, Penny worked in a mattress store and was struck by two realizations: 1) most people shop for mattresses in a state of tension and mistrust because of traditional selling practices, and 2) most conventional or foam mattresses contain toxic chemicals, particularly flame retardants and pesticides, that threaten both human and environmental health. \n \n Penny viewed the bedroom as a key retreat from pollutant exposure, and better sleep as essential to health. In 2003, he opened his own mattress store and in 2006, founded Savvy Rest. Penny made a connection with a natural latex supplier from India, who extended him credit on the strength of a handshake and their shared outlook. Penny chose natural latex, organic wool, and organic cotton as materials for Savvy RestÕs signature mattress because they do not expose sleepers to off-gassing chemicals or pesticide residues.","market":"Developed","industry":"Furniture","sector":"Manufacturing","operatingCountry":"United

The company has ranked in the Inc. 500/5000 roster of AmericaÕs fastest-growing companies for three consecutive years. Savvy RestÕs founder, Michael Penny, took an unusual path to business. He lived for 20 years in a yoga ashram, consuming little and owning less. After leaving that community, Penny worked in a mattress store and was struck by two realizations: 1) most people shop for mattresses in a state of tension and mistrust because of traditional selling practices, and 2) most conventional or foam mattresses contain toxic chemicals, particularly flame retardants and pesticides, that threaten both human and environmental health. \n \n Penny viewed the bedroom as a key retreat from pollutant exposure, and better sleep as essential to health. In 2003, he opened his own mattress store and in 2006, founded Savvy Rest. Penny made a connection with a natural latex supplier from India, who extended him credit on the strength of a handshake and their shared outlook. Penny chose natural latex, organic wool, and organic cotton as materials for Savvy RestÕs signature mattress because they do not expose sleepers to off-gassing chemicals or pesticide residues.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Furniture","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"22903","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1364428800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"80.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Virginia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Charlottesville","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"22903","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"VA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Virginia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Charlottesville","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Crozet","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Vienna","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"dcbcfb1b-4f9e-5b31-ad16-b91716cbdeec","name":"G2 Insurance Services","slug":"g2-insurance-services","description":"G2 Insurance is building their reputation on a tradition of excellence and by being a voice of innovation.

The company is a fourth generation family farm located in the foothills of New Hampshire's White Mountains.\n \nThe company has a strong history of leadership in the egg industry, demonstrating for over decade that consumers demand and are will to pay more for humanely- and ethically-produced eggs from small family farms. Pete and Gerry's became America's first Certified Humane egg producer in 2003, and in 2013 the company became America's first egg producer to achieve the B Corp certification. Pete and Gerry's completed its transition to 100% Certified Humane Free-Range production in 2014.\n \nCurrently approximately 90% of eggs consumed in the US come from hens who live their entire life on factory farms in cramped cages. These giant egg factories are not environmentally sustainable, and have pushed most family scale-producers out of business through consolidation.\n \nPete and Gerry's Organic Eggs produces its Certified Humane Free-Range eggs on over 120 small family farms. These farms are better for the environment, their communities, and consumers. The company seeks to lead a revolution in the way we produce eggs throughout the US.","market":"Developed","industry":"Food products","sector":"Manufacturing","operatingCountry":"United

The company is a fourth generation family farm located in the foothills of New Hampshire's White Mountains.\n \nThe company has a strong history of leadership in the egg industry, demonstrating for over decade that consumers demand and are will to pay more for humanely- and ethically-produced eggs from small family farms. Pete and Gerry's became America's first Certified Humane egg producer in 2003, and in 2013 the company became America's first egg producer to achieve the B Corp certification. Pete and Gerry's completed its transition to 100% Certified Humane Free-Range production in 2014.\n \nCurrently approximately 90% of eggs consumed in the US come from hens who live their entire life on factory farms in cramped cages. These giant egg factories are not environmentally sustainable, and have pushed most family scale-producers out of business through consolidation.\n \nPete and Gerry's Organic Eggs produces its Certified Humane Free-Range eggs on over 120 small family farms. These farms are better for the environment, their communities, and consumers.

Thus, support is necessary to provide tools to entrepreneurs in order for them to achieve success in their projects and to develop and create positive change in society.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Emerging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Management  consultant - for-profits","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"7550315","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Consultoría, Emprendimiento, innovación","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1378339200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"86.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Santiago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Santiago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"7550315","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Santiago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"not listed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Santiago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"41c47616-866b-5957-8308-de60d3869819","name":"Insamar","slug":"insamar","description":"INSAMAR produces reformed tires, using tires whose useful life has ended and solid tires from tire waste process sub-products and scrap of other processes.

Additionally, ChicoBag is working hard to significantly reduce waste in the school fundraising and promotional products industries which are needlessly flooded with unhealthy or cheaply made throwaway products. ChicoBag co-brands their bags and a curated collection of quality reusables for organizations, businesses and schools who share their mission, value quality products, & want to keep their brand or message out of the trash.\n \nChicoBag’s culture thrives on zero-waste. Office waste is weighed and tabulated monthly. Compost is processed by a flock of company chickens. The company has a take-back program that accepts all types of bags from the public, functional or not. They also work with food banks to redistribute the functional bags to those in need and find organizations who can repurpose the others into useful products such as woven rugs. ChicoBag will continue to innovate, challenge the status-quo, and provide the world with ideas and products that help make bagging the single-use habit

They want to communicate stories through audiovisual media, that inspire positive impact. They works primarily on social and environmental films. For example, their film Way Beyond Weight (2012) deals with childhood obesity. This issue afflicts over 30% of the infant population in Brazil. The film was made available online and reached over one million viewers, besides being utilized to coach Brazilian health and educational professionals. Maria Farinha Filmes also has other projects that involve research in children play, Brazilian culture, and activism that are being produced for TV, cinema and the Internet.\n \n Audiovisual content has shown itself to be a tool of extreme efficiency that possesses great potential power for transformation. Unfortunately, themes necessary to improve humanity are generally treated with less care than commercially driven ones. Maria Farinha explores those themes while always searching for quality and excellence.

They want to communicate stories through audiovisual media, that inspire positive impact. They works primarily on social and environmental films. For example, their film Way Beyond Weight (2012) deals with childhood obesity. This issue afflicts over 30% of the infant population in Brazil. The film was made available online and reached over one million viewers, besides being utilized to coach Brazilian health and educational professionals. Maria Farinha Filmes also has other projects that involve research in children play, Brazilian culture, and activism that are being produced for TV, cinema and the Internet.\n \n Audiovisual content has shown itself to be a tool of extreme efficiency that possesses great potential power for transformation. Unfortunately, themes necessary to improve humanity are generally treated with less care than commercially driven ones. Maria Farinha explores those themes while always searching for quality and excellence. Also, in the making of Maria Farinha's films, sets are always functioning with social and environmental concerns in mind.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Emerging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Arts & entertainment","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Brazil","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"05416000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Brazil","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1381104000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"89.9","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Brazil","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Sao Paulo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Pinheiros","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"05416000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Sao Paulo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"São Paulo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Pinheiros","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"77c704bc-9bd5-5ff8-b682-f724fc019da8","name":"Blue Dot Advocates, PBC","slug":"blue-dot-advocates-pbc","description":"Blue Dot Advocates is a network of sophisticated business, nonprofit and intellectual property lawyers driven by a desire to facilitate commercial and investment activity that improves the state of the world.

And the only way to make this happen is by working together. \nTony's raises awareness around child labour and forced labour in cocoa, because for change to happen, everyone has to be aware of current problems, possible solutions and the role we each play.\nTony's leads by example by being 100% traceable from bean-to-bar, because knowing who produces the beans where and under which circumstances is the only way to take full responsibility. Tony's also pays a higher cocoa price that enables cocoa farmers to earn a living. By investing in long-term partnerships and working directly with cocoa cooperatives, as well as working on quality and productivity together with the farmers, Tony's aims to make cocoa farming structurally more sustainable.\nTony's Chocolonely shows that it is possible to make chocolate differently and inspires other to do the same.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Food

And the only way to make this happen is by working together. \nTony's raises awareness around child labour and forced labour in cocoa, because for change to happen, everyone has to be aware of current problems, possible solutions and the role we each play.\nTony's leads by example by being 100% traceable from bean-to-bar, because knowing who produces the beans where and under which circumstances is the only way to take full responsibility. Tony's also pays a higher cocoa price that enables cocoa farmers to earn a living. By investing in long-term partnerships and working directly with cocoa cooperatives, as well as working on quality and productivity together with the farmers, Tony's aims to make cocoa farming structurally more sustainable.\nTony's Chocolonely shows that it is possible to make chocolate differently and inspires other to do the same.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"1014DA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Tony's, Tony's Chocolonely, chocolate, slave free, serious, crazy, 100% slave free, tasty, west africa, ghana, ivory coast, modern slavery, fair, Teun, cocoa","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Austria","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Belgium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ghana","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1387756800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"125.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Noord-Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"1014DA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Hamburg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Noord Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Noord-Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Amsterdam ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Hamburg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York City ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"73c5267b-4597-5c20-935a-e63493a1f6ba","name":"Neil Kelly Company","slug":"neil-kelly-company","description":"Neil Kelly Company is a full-service residential design-build general contractor.

Gluten-free boy (Ian) meets girl (Samantha), and while this generation might look to Netflix to pass the time, Ian and Samantha spent their weekends meeting in Ian's mom's kitchen, baking treats well into the late hours of the night.\n\nAs a result, they created an incredibly decadent cookie out of the best ingredients the local grocery store could stock. Knowing they had something special on their hands, Ian and Samantha wrapped up a few batches and headed to a nearby farmers market.\n\nThe cookies sold out, and now Ian, Samantha, and the team at Emmy's spend their days sending cookies all over the world. They named their company Emmy's, as a nod to Ian's mom who still lets them monopolize her kitchen in exchange for a tray of treats.\n\nEmmy’s is a home grown, family-oriented company, committed to spreading the good word about healthy snacking as well as social and environmental responsibility. Emmy’s B Corp Certification also shows the company’s strong passion for using business as a force for good. Examples of this can be seen in the organic and non-GMO ingredients Emmy’s sources, the way they give back to their community and other causes and the way they treat all people involved with their business. Emmy’s products are made in a wind and solar powered building and much attention is placed on reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nSit back and kick your feet up.

rival any modern day rom-com. Gluten-free boy (Ian) meets girl (Samantha), and while this generation might look to Netflix to pass the time, Ian and Samantha spent their weekends meeting in Ian's mom's kitchen, baking treats well into the late hours of the night.\n\nAs a result, they created an incredibly decadent cookie out of the best ingredients the local grocery store could stock. Knowing they had something special on their hands, Ian and Samantha wrapped up a few batches and headed to a nearby farmers market.\n\nThe cookies sold out, and now Ian, Samantha, and the team at Emmy's spend their days sending cookies all over the world. They named their company Emmy's, as a nod to Ian's mom who still lets them monopolize her kitchen in exchange for a tray of treats.\n\nEmmy’s is a home grown, family-oriented company, committed to spreading the good word about healthy snacking as well as social and environmental responsibility. Emmy’s B Corp Certification also shows the company’s strong passion for using business as a force for good. Examples of this can be seen in the organic and non-GMO ingredients Emmy’s sources, the way they give back to their community and other causes and the way they treat all people involved with their business. Emmy’s products are made in a wind and solar powered building and much attention is placed on reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nSit back and kick your feet up. Emmy's meant to be enjoyed.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"14850","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"glutenfree, foods, packaged foods, vegan, newyork, small, manufacturers","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1388102400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"86.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Ithaca","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"14850","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"NY","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Ithaca","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"86e06426-df46-5e51-a661-06a068ac008b","name":"Business Development Bank of Canada","slug":"business-development-bank-of-canada-bdc","description":"BDC is the only bank devoted exclusively to entrepreneurs.

European-style butter had not made it across the ocean to entice shoppers away from the familiar sweet cream options and goat cheese was still far from a pantry item for most home cooks. Meanwhile in Vermont, two young visionaries, Allison Hooper and Bob Reese were building a business that would, against all odds, introduce American diners to handcrafted goat cheese and later European-style cultured butter – Vermont Creamery. \n\nCrafted in Vermont’s green mountains, Vermont Creamery’s line of fresh and aged goat cheeses, cultured butter, and crème fraîche have won hundreds of national and international awards. In their 35th year of business, Vermont Creamery supports a network of more than 17 family farms, promoting sustainable agriculture in the region. B Corp Certified in 2014, Vermont Creamery has been ranked one of “The Best Places to Work in Vermont,” by Vermont Business Magazine. Vermont Creamery is a subsidiary of Minnesota-based Land O’Lakes, Inc., one of America’s premier agribusiness and food companies.

Creamery","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"description":{"value":"35 years ago, Americans were hard pressed to find much variety in the dairy aisle of their local supermarket, especially when it came to cheese and butter. European-style butter had not made it across the ocean to entice shoppers away from the familiar sweet cream options and goat cheese was still far from a pantry item for most home cooks. Meanwhile in Vermont, two young visionaries, Allison Hooper and Bob Reese were building a business that would, against all odds, introduce American diners to handcrafted goat cheese and later European-style cultured butter – Vermont Creamery. \n\nCrafted in Vermont’s green mountains, Vermont Creamery’s line of fresh and aged goat cheeses, cultured butter, and crème fraîche have won hundreds of national and international awards. In their 35th year of business, Vermont Creamery supports a network of more than 17 family farms, promoting sustainable agriculture in the region. B Corp Certified in 2014, Vermont Creamery has been ranked one of “The Best Places to Work in Vermont,” by Vermont Business Magazine. Vermont Creamery is a subsidiary of Minnesota-based Land O’Lakes, Inc., one of America’s premier agribusiness and food companies.

Today, the company serves millions of gardeners nationwide and is known for its’ award-winning gardening products. Though the company has grown, it remains passionately committed to help people experience the joys of gardening in harmony with nature.\n \nWhen visiting Gardener’s at its corporate headquarters and retail store in Burlington’s Intervale, it’s hard to believe that what is now beautiful gardens, farms and trails was formerly a landfill. In 1986, Gardener’s Supply spearheaded an Intervale clean-up effort to restore the Intervale – 700 acres of bottomland within the city limits of Burlington, Vermont – to its agricultural roots and feed Burlington.\n \nGardener's Supply actively promotes gardening as an important way for people to make the world a better place. The company donates 8% of profits to support programs and organizations that are using gardening to improve the quality of people's lives and the health of our environment. The company provides garden grants across the U.S. and in Vermont that focus on gardening and hunger-relief supporting many community gardens, urban farms and workplace gardens.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other retail sale","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"05401","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1391040000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"91.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Vermont","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Burlington","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"05401","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"DE","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Massachusetts","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New Mexico","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Vermont","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Burlington","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Georgia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Hadley","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Lebanon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Milton","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Williston","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"652f9950-3f40-5f4f-9d6e-c1b817c480f9","name":"Prosperity Candle","slug":"prosperity-candle","description":"Prosperity Candle offers unique gifts for businesses, nonprofits and events - from inexpensive travel tins perfect as give-aways, to luxury candles and fair trade gourmet boxes for your clients, employees, speakers and funders.\n \nThey fully customize gifts with your branding, images, call-to-action and more.
