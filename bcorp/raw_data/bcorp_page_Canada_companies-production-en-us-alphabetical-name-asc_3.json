These investments are made in North American-based businesses that Investeco believes to have some or all of the following characteristics: environmental benefits, established revenues, strong growth prospects, excellent management and long-term competitive advantages, as well as the prospect of providing a profitable exit opportunity within 4 to 7 years from the date of initial investment. Although the funds have a preference for investing in already profitable companies, they sometimes invest in companies that are pre-revenue and/or not yet profitable.","market":"Developed -

These investments are made in North American-based businesses that Investeco believes to have some or all of the following characteristics: environmental benefits, established revenues, strong growth prospects, excellent management and long-term competitive advantages, as well as the prospect of providing a profitable exit opportunity within 4 to 7 years from the date of initial investment.

With a Lantinga Vita bag, made to last from hand-selected materials of the highest quality, you’re always prepared to achieve excellence.\n\nLantinga Vita was founded on the idea to redefine how we carry. We set out to combine the functionality of high-performance sports bag and outdoor gear with luxurious materials that would stand the test of time. As we progressed, we saw first-hand how destructive the fashion industry could be.

It is simply a piece of iron that you use in the cooking process that releases 75% of your daily-required iron intake and is reusable for up to 5 years. The iron is shaped like a fish, a symbol for luck in Cambodia, the country that inspired this health innovation and where The Lucky Iron Fish Project operates and invests – improving both the health and wealth of Cambodian communities. Everything from the fish itself to the packaging and creative tools are produced in Cambodia using recycled materials and in partnership with local social agencies, NGOs and cooperatives. The Lucy Iron Fish Project will solve a preventable health problem that impacts more than 3.5 billion people worldwide and is responsible of a loss of $70 billion of global GDP. The Lucky Iron Fish™ was invented on the principle of providing Cambodians with a safe effective iron supplement solution that is affordable, accessible, and culturally appropriate.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Pharmaceutical products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"M6J 0B6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"health innovation, simple solution, shape of health, iron deficiency, anemia, reusable, natural source of iron, cooking tool","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1395014400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"80.9","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Ontario","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Toronto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"M6J 0B6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"ON","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ontario","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Toronto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"b3f50f61-e129-5540-a1be-20ba13877fc1","name":"Lulubelle & Co","slug":"lulubelle-co","description":"Passion for baking.

They want them to have a bright future. To help get them there, they use robots to engage them in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\n \n Their programs and products are fun and educational. Since 2001, they have been used by 20,000 youth in schools, libraries and museums, among other organizations.\n \n Their main feature is the Jade Robot. Designed for learning by Myke Predko, the Jade Robots draws, dances, and more! It is programmable in Scratch and C+ and is durable, creative, and Made-in-Canada.\n\n Mimetics seeks to inspire a new generation of STEM leaders and practitioners.

markets.\n\nSince 1996, our family has been inventing alternatives to traditional bread products that are made from hearty whole grains, fruits, and seeds. You may recognize us as “Pita Break,” a small bakery founded by Al Ozery and his son Alon that emerged from within our sandwich shop in downtown Toronto. Soon after, Guy joined his father and brother and a family business was born.\n\nDemand grew and in 1998 we began selling our flat breads to local specialty and health food stores in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Not long after, we opened our commercial bakery to support requests for products in Ontario, Quebec, and within the United States.\n\nIn 2016, our business turned twenty years old!  To coincide with our 20th anniversary, we decided to put our family name on everything we make, and thus, Ozery Family Bakery was born.

The approach they take toward product design demonstrates a bias for simplicity and utility.\n\nBuild the best product\nTheir criteria for the best product rests on function, repairability, and, foremost, durability. Among the most direct ways they can limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use. Making the best product matters for saving the planet.\n\nCause no unnecessary harm\nThey know that their business activity—from lighting stores to dyeing shirts—is part of the problem. They work steadily to change their business practices and share what they’ve learned. But they recognize that this is not enough. They seek not only to do less harm, but more good.\n\nUse business to protect nature\nThe challenges faced as a society require leadership. Once they identify a problem, they act. They embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life.\n\nNot bound by convention\nTheir success—and much of the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things.","market":"Developed","industry":"Apparel","sector":"Wholesale/Retail","operatingCountry":"United

style they promoted. The approach they take toward product design demonstrates a bias for simplicity and utility.\n\nBuild the best product\nTheir criteria for the best product rests on function, repairability, and, foremost, durability. Among the most direct ways they can limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use. Making the best product matters for saving the planet.\n\nCause no unnecessary harm\nThey know that their business activity—from lighting stores to dyeing shirts—is part of the problem. They work steadily to change their business practices and share what they’ve learned. But they recognize that this is not enough. They seek not only to do less harm, but more good.\n\nUse business to protect nature\nThe challenges faced as a society require leadership. Once they identify a problem, they act. They embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life.\n\nNot bound by convention\nTheir success—and much of the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"93001-2545","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"outdoor, apparel, clothes, climbing, sports, active lifestyle, skiing, running, climb, jackets, fleece, clothing, gear, activewear, hiking, surfing, bag, pack, shoes, outerwear, duffel, sweatshirt, t-shirt, wetsuit, layers","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Argentina","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Japan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"South Korea","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1324512000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"151.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Ventura","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"93001-2545","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Ventura","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"c6854e94-e447-5181-9425-d0d9979dbf47","name":"PATHFINDER","slug":"pathfinder","description":"PATHFINDER is a for-profit, Canadian social enterprise dedicated to consulting for comprehensive, systemic, and sustainable international development.","market":"Developed -

Producing some of the finest craft beers, our \"farmhouse\" approach integrates onsite farming of hops and honey while sourcing BC grown and malted barley. Their brewery and farm is in part owned by the Sunshine Coast Association for Community Living (SCACL), a non-profit organization providing services for people with developmental disabilities, a number of whom work at the farm. Their annual fundraising events include the Tough Kegger adventure race and the Sunshine Coast Craft Beer Festival, great excuses to have fun and quaff some delicious brews for a good cause.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -

Using a number of proprietary, cutting-edge techniques, our master herbalists and nutritionists extract the most out of each and every ingredient, so that you can be assured of the integrity, potency and purity of each and every one of our products. No shortcuts. No synthetic derivatives.

purchased.\n\ntentree was founded on the premise that every consumer wants to know that they are contributing to the wellbeing of our planet. They believe that they can inspire a new group of consumers to tackle the environmental issues we are now faced with head on, positively impacting our future. They work with a variety of not-for-profits, educational groups, and organizations across the globe to ensure that their planting efforts are having a real, marked impact in the local communities. To date, they have already planted over 25 million trees and have a goal to plant 1 billion trees by 2030.\n\nWith millions of trees planted to date, the impact is easy to see. These trees have provided hundreds of thousands of days of employment in underprivileged communities across the globe which equates to several hundred full-time jobs. Not to mention the countless hours of education that have gone into making these projects a success. The environmental impact is truly astounding as these trees help rejuvenate damaged eco-systems and remove pollution from the atmosphere. With every purchase this impact grows.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"V6A 2E4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"tentree, ten tree, ten tree apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1464048000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"124.6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"British Columbia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Vancouver","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"V6A 2E4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"British Columbia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"SK","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Vancouver","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"bf62a060-f9db-5feb-922b-0fcd36a83a94","name":"Terris","slug":"3d-planeta","description":"Terris is the new era of earth intelligence.\n \nOur cloud-based AI platform represents the new era of earth intelligence as it sources images and data from satellite, aerial, and underwater sources on-demand, and seamlessly fuses and projects 3D visualizations with AI-driven analytics to facilitate faster and more informed decision-making for any place on earth. \nWe help clients navigate through uncertainty, change and crisis.\n\nFor more information visit our website www.TerrisEI.com\nTerris is a 100 percent Canadian-owned private corporation (CCPC), founded in 2018.","market":"Developed -
