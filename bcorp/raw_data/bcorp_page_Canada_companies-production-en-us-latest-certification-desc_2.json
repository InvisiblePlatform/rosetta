By blending students’ physical and virtual learning, the program reframes their progress in school as a game they play together throughout the year. \n\nThe ecosystem of tools integrates all aspects of the classroom, from gamified personalized learning to formative assessment and classroom management. The game mechanics encourage students help one another, stay on task, and take an active stance against bullying.

Our offering includes ketchups, BBQ sauces, fresh cooking sauces and turmeric teas. Our products are available across Canada and US and are sold under brand names Good Food For Good and Turmeric Teas.\n\nThe company was founded by Richa Gupta, a marketer and mother of a 12 year old girl. As a working mother, Richa found it very challenging to find packaged food and prepared shortcuts that met her expectations for taste and ingredient quality. Frustrated with being forced to compromise quality for convenience, Richa launched Good Foor For Good to make it easy for every one to eat well and do good. Inspired by TOMS Shoes, Richa adopted the Buy One Feed One model for her food business. Richa is proud to have made a positive difference in over 600,000 meals and is actively working on reaching her goal of feeding 1 million people every year.","market":"Developed -

Our food is made using organic ingredients and is free from allergens, refined sugar and preservatives. That’s not all, every time you buy our products, we donate money to feed someone in need. Our offering includes ketchups, BBQ sauces, fresh cooking sauces and turmeric teas. Our products are available across Canada and US and are sold under brand names Good Food For Good and Turmeric Teas.\n\nThe company was founded by Richa Gupta, a marketer and mother of a 12 year old girl. As a working mother, Richa found it very challenging to find packaged food and prepared shortcuts that met her expectations for taste and ingredient quality. Frustrated with being forced to compromise quality for convenience, Richa launched Good Foor For Good to make it easy for every one to eat well and do good. Inspired by TOMS Shoes, Richa adopted the Buy One Feed One model for her food business. Richa is proud to have made a positive difference in over 600,000 meals and is actively working on reaching her goal of feeding 1 million people every year.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food

They want them to have a bright future. To help get them there, they use robots to engage them in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\n \n Their programs and products are fun and educational. Since 2001, they have been used by 20,000 youth in schools, libraries and museums, among other organizations.\n \n Their main feature is the Jade Robot. Designed for learning by Myke Predko, the Jade Robots draws, dances, and more! It is programmable in Scratch and C+ and is durable, creative, and Made-in-Canada.\n\n Mimetics seeks to inspire a new generation of STEM leaders and practitioners.

Like any digital agency, they know their way around technology and they believe in returning good value to clients. There are a few things that make them a little different than your average digital production house:\n\nThey focus on improving community outcomes; improving the community they serve is more important than maximizing profit.\n\nThey know that with real, lasting change, there is tension. They aren't afraid of it... in fact, they welcome it.\n\nThey are committed to helping smooth out the bumps in the process of change to keep it productive, and they confirm that's what they're doing

Before both minimalism and sustainability became trends, Eileen Fisher had the vision of a company guided by a distinctive aesthetic and an ongoing commitment to supporting women and making a positive impact in the world. In 1984, inspired by the lasting elegance and ease of the Japanese kimono, Eileen designed four simple shapes to debut at the boutique show. Three decades later, she has turned her initial $350 into $400 million (without ever engaging investors), with more than 60 stores worldwide. And most importantly, she’s pioneered a socially conscious company while becoming an icon in the fashion industry for timeless design.\n \nToday, EILEEN FISHER supports women through the collection, simplifying life and inspiring women to express their personal style, as well as through social initiatives such as the Women’s Business Grant Program, created to empower women-owned businesses, the Activating Leadership Grant, which funds programs that activate leadership qualities in women and girls and the one-of-a-kind recycle retail concept Green Eileen, which donates profits to support women, girls and environment.","market":"Developed","industry":"Apparel","sector":"Wholesale/Retail","operatingCountry":"United States","operatingProvince":"New

Before both minimalism and sustainability became trends, Eileen Fisher had the vision of a company guided by a distinctive aesthetic and an ongoing commitment to supporting women and making a positive impact in the world. In 1984, inspired by the lasting elegance and ease of the Japanese kimono, Eileen designed four simple shapes to debut at the boutique show. Three decades later, she has turned her initial $350 into $400 million (without ever engaging investors), with more than 60 stores worldwide. And most importantly, she’s pioneered a socially conscious company while becoming an icon in the fashion industry for timeless design.\n \nToday, EILEEN FISHER supports women through the collection, simplifying life and inspiring women to express their personal style, as well as through social initiatives such as the Women’s Business Grant Program, created to empower women-owned businesses, the Activating Leadership Grant, which funds programs that activate leadership qualities in women and girls and the one-of-a-kind recycle retail concept Green Eileen, which donates profits to support women, girls and environment.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"10533","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1450396800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"89.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Irvington","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"10533","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"BC","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Berkshire","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"NY","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New Jersey","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Irvington","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York City","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Reading ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Secaucus ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Vancouver","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"d9242664-ef43-5715-9364-63e9ec086a14","name":"Ellio Inc","slug":"ellio-inc","description":"Ellio is a bilingual team of 6 consultants passionate about making organizations more sustainable.

Why? Bulk under t-shirts from big buckles; \"muffin-top\" from pinching leather; and the hassle of threading a belt into and out of belt loops.\n \nTheir team designed Unbelt because we needed a better solution. Their belts are super comfy, completely bulkless, and machine-washable right in the belt loops. Adjustable to fit sizes 0 through 24X, they close the gap at the back of our customers' jeans - in other words, creating a perfect fit without the need for pricey tailoring.\n \nThey distribute through a network of over 300 Canadian retailers, and through our website to customers from Iceland to Estonia. They speak loudly about the need for supply chain transparency in the fashion industry, and for the rights of garment workers to equitable working conditions. It's a \"who, not where\" approach to ethical fashion, because they believe that quality jobs are possible - and necessary - everywhere in the world that clothing is made.\n \nThey're small, but growing. They value resilience, bootstrapping, and community-growing. Their clients are like gold to them, and they work hard to make sure they know how highly they're valued.","market":"Developed -

- loose waistbands, saggy stretch denim - but almost none of us regularly wear a belt. Why? Bulk under t-shirts from big buckles; \"muffin-top\" from pinching leather; and the hassle of threading a belt into and out of belt loops.\n \nTheir team designed Unbelt because we needed a better solution. Their belts are super comfy, completely bulkless, and machine-washable right in the belt loops. Adjustable to fit sizes 0 through 24X, they close the gap at the back of our customers' jeans - in other words, creating a perfect fit without the need for pricey tailoring.\n \nThey distribute through a network of over 300 Canadian retailers, and through our website to customers from Iceland to Estonia. They speak loudly about the need for supply chain transparency in the fashion industry, and for the rights of garment workers to equitable working conditions. It's a \"who, not where\" approach to ethical fashion, because they believe that quality jobs are possible - and necessary - everywhere in the world that clothing is made.\n \nThey're small, but growing. They value resilience, bootstrapping, and community-growing. Their clients are like gold to them, and they work hard to make sure they know how highly they're valued.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"T6E 0Z2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"fashion, accessories, Canada, China, ethical manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"China","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1445904000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"89.6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Alberta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Edmonton","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"T6E 0Z2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"AB","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Alberta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Kansas","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Edmonton","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Lawrence","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"0be49793-c95f-5c13-b978-162a4fd07879","name":"GROSCHE International Inc.","slug":"grosche-international-inc","description":"GROSCHE is a social enterprise that manufactures and distributes coffee, tea, and water accessories.

Producing some of the finest craft beers, our \"farmhouse\" approach integrates onsite farming of hops and honey while sourcing BC grown and malted barley. Their brewery and farm is in part owned by the Sunshine Coast Association for Community Living (SCACL), a non-profit organization providing services for people with developmental disabilities, a number of whom work at the farm.

It is simply a piece of iron that you use in the cooking process that releases 75% of your daily-required iron intake and is reusable for up to 5 years. The iron is shaped like a fish, a symbol for luck in Cambodia, the country that inspired this health innovation and where The Lucky Iron Fish Project operates and invests – improving both the health and wealth of Cambodian communities. Everything from the fish itself to the packaging and creative tools are produced in Cambodia using recycled materials and in partnership with local social agencies, NGOs and cooperatives. The Lucy Iron Fish Project will solve a preventable health problem that impacts more than 3.5 billion people worldwide and is responsible of a loss of $70 billion of global GDP. The Lucky Iron Fish™ was invented on the principle of providing Cambodians with a safe effective iron supplement solution that is affordable, accessible, and culturally

It is simply a piece of iron that you use in the cooking process that releases 75% of your daily-required iron intake and is reusable for up to 5 years. The iron is shaped like a fish, a symbol for luck in Cambodia, the country that inspired this health innovation and where The Lucky Iron Fish Project operates and invests – improving both the health and wealth of Cambodian communities. Everything from the fish itself to the packaging and creative tools are produced in Cambodia using recycled materials and in partnership with local social agencies, NGOs and cooperatives. The Lucy Iron Fish Project will solve a preventable health problem that impacts more than 3.5 billion people worldwide and is responsible of a loss of $70 billion of global GDP. The Lucky Iron Fish™ was invented on the principle of providing Cambodians with a safe effective iron supplement solution that is affordable, accessible, and culturally appropriate.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Pharmaceutical
