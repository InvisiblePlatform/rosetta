They aim to generate attractive risk-adjusted financial returns for our investors alongside measurable positive social and/or environmental impact. Founded in 2002, Bridges has since raised over $1bn of investor capital across its platform of Sustainable Growth, Property and Social Sector Funds. \n\nBridges invests in business, properties, social enterprises and outcomes contracts that help to address pressing long-term social and environmental challenges, with a focus on four key impact themes: health & well-being, education & skills, sustainable living and underserved markets. Their strategy is to focus on opportunities where growth and impact go hand-in-hand; that is, where achieving important social and environmental goals also drives better performance. This could be by backing businesses that generate jobs in areas of high unemployment, building environmentally-friendly care homes for the elderly to sustain our ageing population, or providing flexible financing for innovative youth employment programmes.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -

Each of the 4 members play a crucial role in the continued success of this model, which is based on values.

Their projects are structured in this way to make it easy for professionals to find time to volunteer in the midst of their busy daily lives. They charge nonprofits and social enterprises less than 5% of the cost that they would normally pay for the professional services our volunteers provide. Their service is free for all professionals willing to donate their time. They also help corporations offer their skills-based volunteer opportunities for their employees.\n \nCatchafire's mission is to provide talented individuals with meaningful pro bono experiences in order to build capacity for social good organizations. They believe that all social good organizations should have access to top talent, that all people should have the opportunity to use their talents for good, and that people should have the opportunity

The company helps clients avoid profiting from the exploitation of people and the environment, while working with clients and their capital to press for a healthier, more sustainable society.\n \nA pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing (SRI), Clean Yield began in 1985 as a stock-market newsletter that provided buy and sell advice on socially and financially screened securities. Subscribers could avoid tobacco, alcohol, gambling, pornography, weapons, nuclear power, defense contractors, and a number of other areas of concern. Instead, they could direct their investments toward companies with products and services making positive social contributions. Within two years, the principals formed Clean Yield Asset Management, which serves SRI clients by buying and selling securities on their behalf. Clean Yield’s services also include community investing, slow-money investing, and “shareholder activism”—i.e., using the ownership of a company’s shares for leverage in advancing corporate responsibility.","market":"Developed","industry":"Investment advising","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","operatingCountry":"United

social impact. The company helps clients avoid profiting from the exploitation of people and the environment, while working with clients and their capital to press for a healthier, more sustainable society.\n \nA pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing (SRI), Clean Yield began in 1985 as a stock-market newsletter that provided buy and sell advice on socially and financially screened securities. Subscribers could avoid tobacco, alcohol, gambling, pornography, weapons, nuclear power, defense contractors, and a number of other areas of concern. Instead, they could direct their investments toward companies with products and services making positive social contributions. Within two years, the principals formed Clean Yield Asset Management, which serves SRI clients by buying and selling securities on their behalf. Clean Yield’s services also include community investing, slow-money investing, and “shareholder activism”—i.e., using the ownership of a company’s shares for leverage in advancing corporate responsibility.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Investment

We're creating positive changes to the way we consume food by replacing single use plastics with all natural, sustainably sourced, eco friendly and regenerative products. Our values of health, sustainability and community are an important part of everything that we do and the best part, they were inspired by you. By creating products with purpose, we are able to do well by doing good for both people and the planet. Our range of all natural products includes Coconut Bowls (3 sizes), Bamboo Cups,Wooden Cutlery, Coconut Candles, Plant Based Cookbooks, Zero Waste Market Bags and more.\n\nWe reimagined the waste streams of the coconut tree and realised it’s one of the most sustainable plants on the planet.

Their goal is to make coffee-growing a sustainable and beneficial endeavor for farmer families and their communities.\n\nCooperative Coffees was founded in 1999 with a desire to make a positive change in the world of coffee.

Today Cooperative Coffees has 23 roaster members located throughout North America leveraging their voice and purchasing power.\n\nTheir Carbon, Climate and Coffee Initiative calculates and tracks Cooperative Coffees’ collective carbon footprint and contributes a corresponding financial offset, a “voluntary carbon tax”, to their producer-support fund, investing in projects in their producer partner communities. \n\nCooperative Coffees is more than a coffee importer. They seek to improve the livelihood of small-scale coffee farmers in Latin America, Africa and Asia, provide services to their members, and create connections that have regenerative and sustainable impact.","market":"Developed","industry":"Food products","sector":"Wholesale/Retail","operatingCountry":"United States","operatingProvince":"Georgia","size":"1-9","operatingPostalCode":"31709","websiteKeywords":"coffee, organic, fairtrade, cooperative, importer, roaster","countries":["United States"],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":1537401600000,"latestVerifiedScore":"106.2","assessments":[{"overallScore":"106.2","ratingDate":1537401600000,"fullTimeWorkers":5,"impactAreas":[{"name":"Governance","score":"14.9","sfid":"a0SC000000LBrZPMA1","impactTopics":[{"name":"Mission & Engagement","score":"1.6","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmJMAU"},{"name":"Corporate Accountability","score":"2.8","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmIMAU"},{"name":"Transparency","score":"2.9","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmKMAU"},{"name":"Mission Locked","score":"7.5","isIbm":true,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLlSMAU"}]},{"name":"Workers","score":"24.4","sfid":"a0SC000000LBraNMAT","impactTopics":[{"name":"Compensation & Wages","score":"9.5","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmTMAU"},{"name":"Benefits","score":"3.6","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmSMAU"},{"name":"Training & Education","score":"1.3","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmRMAU"},{"name":"Worker Ownership","score":"0.0","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmaMAE"},{"name":"Management & Worker Communication","score":"4.7","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmdMAE"}]},{"name":"Community","score":"43.8","sfid":"a0SC000000LBrawMAD","impactTopics":[{"name":"Job Creation","score":"1.7","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmnMAE"},{"name":"Diversity & Inclusion","score":"1.8","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmoMAE"},{"name":"Civic Engagement & Giving","score":"1.5","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmlMAE"},{"name":"Local Involvement","score":"0.3","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmmMAE"},{"name":"Suppliers, Distributors & Product","score":"10.5","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLmpMAE"},{"name":"Supply Chain Poverty Alleviation","score":"27.4","isIbm":true,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLlLMAU"}]},{"name":"Environment","score":"23.0","sfid":"a0SC000000LBrbfMAD","impactTopics":[{"name":"Land, Office, Plant","score":"2.8","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLn3MAE"},{"name":"Inputs","score":"4.8","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLn2MAE"},{"name":"Outputs","score":"0.0","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLn1MAE"},{"name":"Transportation, Distribution & Suppliers","score":"0.0","isIbm":false,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLn0MAE"},{"name":"Environment Products & Services Introduction","score":"0.0","isIbm":true,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLlXMAU"},{"name":"Toxin Reduction / Remediation","score":"15.4","isIbm":true,"sfid":"a0FC000000tlLlgMAE"}]},{"name":"Customers","score":"0.0","sfid":"a0SC000000Roe9LMAR","impactTopics":[]}],"bestForTheWorldAwards":[]}],"files":[],"legacyBestForTheWorldAwards":[],"companyLogo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/blab-impact-published-production/public/8yFAp1tHdpnSwjPrhaPdwE1j5eAuWohd0svJOCGa","lifestyleLogo":"","website":"coopcoffees.coop","hqCountry":"United States","hqProvince":"Georgia","hqCity":"Americus","hqPostalCode":"31709","provinces":["Georgia","MN"],"cities":["Americus"],"contentDigest":"2f8c7923cf400b09b40e27c1150ae1ae","objectID":"a9c5d958-1c7f-5d0e-a3cf-88bca03ddd54","_snippetResult":{"description":{"value":"Cooperative Coffees exists to import high-quality, organic green coffee from small-scale farmer organizations to build long-term relationships","matchLevel":"none"}},"_highlightResult":{"name":{"value":"Cooperative Coffees, Inc","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"description":{"value":"Cooperative Coffees exists to import high-quality, organic green coffee from small-scale farmer organizations to build long-term relationships and foster fair, transparent, and equitable trading practices.

With its affiliate PHI, CHCA responds to these challenges by providing free training and guaranteed, high-quality employment for hundreds of women each year.\n \nRecognizing that many participants face significant, compound barriers to employment, CHCA’s workforce development program provides comprehensive home health training with guaranteed jobs for graduates, targeted mentoring, and a range of supports to help individuals effectively address both professional and personal challenges as they transition to work.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Home health care","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Significant Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"10458","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Worker cooperative, Co-ops, Direct care workforce, Adult learner-centered training, Entry-level development, Bronx, NY,new york city nyc Coaching consulting services, curriculum Home care health healthcare jobs women employment CHCA PHI elderly disability","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1339632000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"140.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Bronx","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"10458","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"NY","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Bronx","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"d9b78c1d-3846-551f-a6ee-5286c5229d5a","name":"CoPeace","slug":"co-peace","description":"CoPeace is a first-of-its-kind holding company, building a portfolio of carefully screened for-profit companies whose mission is having measurable social and/or environmental impact.
