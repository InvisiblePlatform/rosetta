A pioneer in the impact management space in 2001, they've worked with impact investors, businesses, nonprofit organizations, foundations, and governmental entities of every stage and scale worldwide. Today, SVT-designed systems have been used to assess the impact of over $9Bn in private equity, debt and grant assets. \n \nEvery group has a compelling impact story to tell. Understanding, quantifying, and scaling that impact, however, can be extremely difficult for businesses to undertake alone. As demands for accountability and transparency grow, SVT wants to ensure that impact management and business management are no longer at odds with one another - that, in fact, when the two are properly combined, companies can truly achieve a triple bottom line.\n \nSVT envisions a world in which it pays to do good. The dominant approach to valuation ignores much of what matters, resulting in a hollowing out of the American Dream, dangerous depletion of the earth's natural resources, and rampant inequality throughout the world.","market":"Developed","industry":"Other professional, scientific & tech","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","operatingCountry":"United

metabolism. A pioneer in the impact management space in 2001, they've worked with impact investors, businesses, nonprofit organizations, foundations, and governmental entities of every stage and scale worldwide. Today, SVT-designed systems have been used to assess the impact of over $9Bn in private equity, debt and grant assets. \n \nEvery group has a compelling impact story to tell. Understanding, quantifying, and scaling that impact, however, can be extremely difficult for businesses to undertake alone. As demands for accountability and transparency grow, SVT wants to ensure that impact management and business management are no longer at odds with one another - that, in fact, when the two are properly combined, companies can truly achieve a triple bottom line.\n \nSVT envisions a world in which it pays to do good. The dominant approach to valuation ignores much of what matters, resulting in a hollowing out of the American Dream, dangerous depletion of the earth's natural resources, and rampant inequality throughout the world.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other professional, scientific & tech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"95035","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"impact, impact measurement, social impact, environmental impact, measurement and evaluation, impact accounting, impact management, sustainability, sustainability consulting, impact investing, social capital, M&E, CSR, ESG, integrated reporting, valuation,","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1202947200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"93.8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Milpitas","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"95035","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Milpitas","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"abdefd10-37dc-528a-b354-7d558a158261","name":"Be More America","slug":"be-more-inc","description":"BE MORE uses science-based tools to enhance performance, well-being and belonging in the workplace.\nThey are a data & content company that trains professionals in science-based tools that measurably reduce bias.\n\nBE MORE works at the intersection of Learning & Development, ​Wellness, and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.\nTheir programs are data-driven, shame-free, and solutions-oriented.

Today, drawing on best practices from the outdoor industry and global development sector, they create innovative outdoor products and experiences that help alleviate poverty, move people to do good, and inspire adventure.\n \n Founded as a Benefit Corporation with social purpose built into its DNA, Cotopaxi is committed to inspiring social and environmental change as a means to improve the human condition, increase social consciousness, and alleviate poverty through its core values and giving initiatives. Becoming a B Corp directly aligns with this business model, ensuring that Cotopaxi is able to closely monitor its performance against its goals as the company grows and evolves.\n \n In pursuit of these goals, Cotopaxi’s values are infused into all aspects of its operations. On a local level, employees enjoy “in-the-wild” time, where they spend 10% of their work time adventuring outdoors or doing service. Cotopaxi has launched a skills-based volunteering initiative that leverages the time and talent of employees and responds to a clear need in the community.","market":"Developed","industry":"Apparel","sector":"Wholesale/Retail","operatingCountry":"United

October of 2013, Cotopaxi’s founders set out with the goal of building an outdoor gear company that could make meaningful strides toward reducing global poverty. Today, drawing on best practices from the outdoor industry and global development sector, they create innovative outdoor products and experiences that help alleviate poverty, move people to do good, and inspire adventure.\n \n Founded as a Benefit Corporation with social purpose built into its DNA, Cotopaxi is committed to inspiring social and environmental change as a means to improve the human condition, increase social consciousness, and alleviate poverty through its core values and giving initiatives. Becoming a B Corp directly aligns with this business model, ensuring that Cotopaxi is able to closely monitor its performance against its goals as the company grows and evolves.\n \n In pursuit of these goals, Cotopaxi’s values are infused into all aspects of its operations. On a local level, employees enjoy “in-the-wild” time, where they spend 10% of their work time adventuring outdoors or doing service. Cotopaxi has launched a skills-based volunteering initiative that leverages the time and talent of employees and responds to a clear need in the community.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"84101","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Outdoor, sustainability, benefit corporation, global development, health, education, livelihoods, poverty alleviation, Cotopaxi, Gear for Good, backpacks, apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1451260800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"93.6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Utah","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Salt Lake City","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"84101","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"DE","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Utah","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Salt Lake City","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"e5a73210-590a-5328-ba66-57ffedff7562","name":"Plant Prefab","slug":"plant-prefab","description":"Building a better world, by design.\n\nPlant Prefab is the first prefabricated design and construction company in the United States dedicated to sustainable construction, materials, processes, and operations.

As employers and dairy farmers, they still honor the frugal values of those bygone times. Over the years they’ve thrived and grown through the hard work, collaborative spirit, and persistent commitment of 1200 family farm owners throughout New England and Upstate New York who raise their herds to produce quality milk.\n \nThey hold to generations of family traditions while adopting new best practices, advancing public agriculture policy and driving sustainable innovations to benefit the land, improve animal care and enrich communities on behalf of their families and consumers. And they’re part of a rare remaining breed of dairy manufacturers in the Northeast that are locally owned and operated.\n \nCabot Creamery celebrates a nearly century-old commitment to returning 100% of profits to the farm family owners whose industrious stewardship provides fair wage employment to hundreds, sustains open working landscapes, and safeguards their core heritage of family

They continue to add alternative energy and eco-technologies as they grow, and they have always manufactured the most Earth-friendly printed marketing medium available. Their seed paper is crafted from 100% post-industrial, recycled paper and dyed with all-natural, vegetable-based pigments. Their products are printed with water-based inks and, when included, use corn-based packaging.

In those early years, all of Nossa Familia’s coffee was imported directly from Augusto’s family’s farms in Brazil; over time Nossa Familia has developed direct relationships with coffee growers around the world.\n\nNow with a roasting facility and espresso bar in Northwest Portland, Nossa Familia Coffee supplies wholesale accounts and customers across the Rose City and beyond with conscientiously-sourced and meticulously-roasted coffee from various growing regions. Coffee quality, mutually beneficial relationships with producers, engaging and supporting the local community, minimizing environmental footprint, and having fun remain fundamental to Nossa Familia’s reason for being.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Agricultural Processing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"97210","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"coffee; roaster; coffee roaster; cafe; espresso; organic; Portland; Oregon; origin; farmers; direct trade; relationships","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1454976000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"91.3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Oregon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Portland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"97210","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"OR","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Oregon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Portland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"b006e64a-c03e-553f-8d49-ad6e3550880d","name":"Planet Bluegrass","slug":"planet-bluegrass","description":"For more than two decades, Planet Bluegrass has worked to present the finest musical experiences in some of the country’s most magnificent natural environments while striving to reduce our environmental footprint at the same time.\n \n Over the years, Planet Bluegrass has embraced some simple environmental solutions -- like providing free filtered water and waste reduction incentives and mandates at their festivals to cut down on plastic bottles and other trash.

They were the first to bring the classic, European cotton string market bags to the US.\n \n They use third parties to certify that their supply chain and manufacturing meet or exceed international standards for materials and social conduct. All of the inks used in their custom printing are PVC and phthalate-free, their dyes are AZO free. They do these things not because they have to but because they're the right thing to do. They're very selective about whose merchandise they carry at ECOBAGS.com and they encourage all of their partnering manufacturers to comply with their high standards.\n \n Eco-Bags Products knows that there is no \"away\" in our throwaway society.

responsibly made bags using natural, recycled, organic and recyclable materials for retail, resale, promotions, packaging and design. At Eco-Bags Products, they're innovators - they were one of the first to introduce reusable bags to the market in 1992. They were the first to bring the classic, European cotton string market bags to the US.\n \n They use third parties to certify that their supply chain and manufacturing meet or exceed international standards for materials and social conduct. All of the inks used in their custom printing are PVC and phthalate-free, their dyes are AZO free. They do these things not because they have to but because they're the right thing to do. They're very selective about whose merchandise they carry at ECOBAGS.com and they encourage all of their partnering manufacturers to comply with their high standards.\n \n Eco-Bags Products knows that there is no \"away\" in our throwaway society.

through trusted relationships. Headquartered in Lewiston, the Bank has been fiercely independent for 150 years offering innovative banking solutions to meet clients’ individual needs. Androscoggin Bank is Member FDIC.\n\nAndroscoggin Bank is part of a small number of banks nationally who share in their commitment to leverage business as a force of good in their world.

While product-driven, our company’s no.1 goal is to reduce waste and preserve the Earth’s non-renewable resources. Each item we sell is thoughtfully vetted to be part of a healthy and purposeful environment. Our products are non-toxic and made humanely, and the factories where they are made place workers’ rights at the forefront of their business and operations. EPP supports and protects diversity and inclusion by working with organizations that hire accordingly. We insist on being accessible to help promotionally brand organizations of all sizes from visionary one-person start-ups with shoestring budgets to Fortune 500 companies.\n\n\nOffering high-quality, affordable products is part of the EPP mission. For every invoiced order, no matter how small, we dedicate a tree planting in the name of the company or individual through Trees for the Future. With the purchase of many of our products, additional donations are made to organizations such as 1 Percent for the Planet, Wounded Warrior Foundation, Shelter to Soldier and others.

Through sales of organic, fairly traded coffee; community projects; and origin delegations, Higher Grounds offers coffee drinkers the opportunity to directly benefit producer communities.\n  \nExceptional coffee is produced within a circle that begins with and returns to farmers at origin. When coffee professionals focus on the wellbeing of individuals all along the supply chain, the sustainability of the entire cycle is improved. The greatest potential for impact is at coffee origin, where producers face challenges mostly unseen by consumers of their product: poverty, lack of clean water access, severely limited educational opportunities. If the entire specialty coffee industry saw quality through a lens that also illuminated the realities of life as a coffee farmer, those realities could be improved for more of the individuals responsible for our daily cup.

When coffee professionals focus on the wellbeing of individuals all along the supply chain, the sustainability of the entire cycle is improved. The greatest potential for impact is at coffee origin, where producers face challenges mostly unseen by consumers of their product: poverty, lack of clean water access, severely limited educational opportunities. If the entire specialty coffee industry saw quality through a lens that also illuminated the realities of life as a coffee farmer, those realities could be improved for more of the individuals responsible for our daily cup.

Since 2003, health-conscious people have been choosing our organic superfoods because they’re a diverse whole-food source of antioxidants, protein, essential fats, minerals, vitamins and other key nutrients. \n\nNavitas Naturals was founded in 2003 to bring energizing superfoods to North America to invigorate the modern ‘Western’ diet. Our organic superfoods come from ancient cultures around the world where they are traditionally used for both nutritional and medicinal purposes. Health-conscious people choose our nutrient-dense superfoods because they are an abundant whole-food source of antioxidants, protein, essential fats, vitamins, minerals and other key nutrients. \n\nNutrient-rich whole foods are at their best when they’re produced by organic agriculture and minimal processing. That’s why all our products are certified organic and use methods such as freeze-drying and low temperature processing to ensure maximum nutrition and flavor.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"94949","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Navitas Naturals, organic, superfoods","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1469145600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"90.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Novato","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"94949","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"DE","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Novato","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"fde50b9a-1add-595c-a079-65120a1aca2f","name":"Aspen Medical","slug":"aspen-medical","description":"Founded in 2003 by Glenn Keys and Dr Andrew Walker, Aspen Medical is a multi-award winning, global provider of guaranteed and innovative healthcare solutions across a diverse range clients in the Defence, Government, Humanitarian, Public Healthcare, Resources and Extractives and Indigenous health sectors.
