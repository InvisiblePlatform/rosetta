TOMbag created the world’s first fully circular solution for waste disposal: their reusable garbage bags are made out of post-consumer waste using GRS certified recycled plastic and can be fully upcycled at the end of their life. TOMbag reusable garbage bags are designed to last, are easily washable and 100% waterproof. They can be used for all kinds of waste and occasions (general waste, recyclables and even compost - at home and at such occasions as camping). TOMbag also works with businesses providing them with different sizes of reusable garbage bags including custom-made solutions. TOMbag is committed to donate at least 3% of its revenues to charitable partners with an environmental focus. As a part of this commitment TOMbag plants a tree in Australia for each sale made via a partnership with One Tree Planted.

All the ingredients we use have excellent biocompatibility. We use eco-friendly ingredients. We procure plant-based ingredients from recycle-oriented farmers. We select materials with minimum residual risks and those that are produced without using alcohol or other solvents that may have negative impacts on the environment. These selections are made based on our strict standards. \n  We have developed our original \"Kinu Biyo\" (Silk Beautification), in which we polish up the skin using the Sericin Beaute water-warmed brushes. We have developed this method by combining the master craftsmanship of the Kumano Fude brush and purely-domestic rare silk. It is a relaxation technique that leads one into a deep sleep by approaching the fascia and meridians deep within the skin.

A solution to thoughtful party favours that wouldn't end up in a land fill or ocean somewhere.\n\nThe Paper Party Bag Shop have never used plastic in any of their toys and the packaging is made from potato/corn starch, clearly labeled and compostable when disposed of correctly. They only use suppliers who share their values so there is no plastic in their supply chain either.
