Pete and Gerry's completed its transition to 100% Certified Humane Free-Range production in 2014.\n \nCurrently approximately 90% of eggs consumed in the US come from hens who live their entire life on factory farms in cramped cages. These giant egg factories are not environmentally sustainable, and have pushed most family scale-producers out of business through consolidation.\n \nPete and Gerry's Organic Eggs produces its Certified Humane Free-Range eggs on over 120 small family farms. These farms are better for the environment, their communities, and consumers. The company seeks to lead a revolution in the way we produce eggs throughout the US.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"03771-3114","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Eggs, Organic eggs, cage-free eggs, Certified Humane, Certified Organic, family farms, pasture raised eggs, regenerative farming, regenerative agriculture, brown eggs, sustainable farming, sustainable food, Nellie's Free Range, Consider Pastures","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1367884800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"100.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New Hampshire","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Monroe","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"03771-3114","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"NH","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New Hampshire","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Pennsylvania","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Greencastle","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Lebanon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Monroe","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ono","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"d4782923-346e-505a-852d-32e13b9e5c1c","name":"Positive Energy Solar","slug":"sunpower-positive-energy-solar","description":"As a leading solar energy company in New Mexico, Positive Energy Solar integrates solar electric systems for businesses, homeowners, and institutions across New Mexico.

Additionally, ChicoBag is working hard to significantly reduce waste in the school fundraising and promotional products industries which are needlessly flooded with unhealthy or cheaply made throwaway products. ChicoBag co-brands their bags and a curated collection of quality reusables for organizations, businesses and schools who share their mission, value quality products, & want to keep their brand or message out of the trash.\n \nChicoBag’s culture thrives on zero-waste. Office waste is weighed and tabulated monthly. Compost is processed by a flock of company chickens. The company has a take-back program that accepts all types of bags from the public, functional or not. They also work with food banks to redistribute the functional bags to those in need and find organizations who can repurpose the others into useful products such as woven rugs. ChicoBag will continue to innovate, challenge the status-quo, and provide the world with ideas and products that help make bagging the single-use habit

The company has a take-back program that accepts all types of bags from the public, functional or not. They also work with food banks to redistribute the functional bags to those in need and find organizations who can repurpose the others into useful products such as woven rugs.

In 2006, the group welcomed Michael Davies as winemaker resulting in more collective Oregon winemaking experience for A to Z than any other winery, experience that can make a difference in difficult vintages. Soon after, the families partnered with Gregg Popovich (NBA Head Coach of the San Antonio Spurs) and a few others to buy the 25-year-old property, REX HILL Vineyards and Winery. They reduced REX HILL production by 77%, refining and refocusing the brand to achieve the highest quality and were honored with a Wine Spectator Top 100 Wines of the Year award two years later.\n \nA

They aspire to promote composting in an effective and educational way to engage their local communities to be more sustainable. They feel that food scraps and the other organic components to the waste stream should be considered a natural resource that can be conserved through composting. A key component to their business model has been to “close the loop” through their Compost Credit Program.\n \nNOPE is a proud member of the US & Virginia Compost Council. They have spent years developing Best Managed Practices (BMP’s) through research as well as trial and error. NOPE prides itself as being local, responsive, & engaged with their partners. Their partners include large institutions as well as small sustainable minded local businesses. They believe that that the myriad of small environmental benefits of composting add up to significant environmental & social benefits.\n \nThrough their Compost Credit program they have functionally closed the loop of organic recycling or composting as it is more commonly known. They have returned premium compost for use in school & local community gardens in their service area.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other land transport","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Significant Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"23233","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Compost collection, Organic Recycling, Richmond, VA, Sustainability, Compost, Recycling, Waste diversion, Food Waste, Recycling, Composting, Environmental, Eco-friendly, Stewardship, Hauling, Central & Eastern VA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1401321600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"100.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Virginia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Richmond","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"23233","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"VA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Virginia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Richmond","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"9dd08fae-b7e2-5ad2-ae4d-1cae86b46195","name":"Grove Collaborative Inc.","slug":"grove-collaborative","description":"Grove Collaborative is an online retailer that creates innovative natural products and offers a curated selection of healthy home and personal care essentials.

While they work on many types of projects, the core of Old Structure's practice is the profession of structural engineering. There are many definitions of the field, but they all share several concepts: their work includes analysis and design of buildings and other structures for real-world loads, in order to provide for safe and serviceable use. Because Old Structures works with existing buildings, their analyses often include investigation of existing conditions or failure. In fact, their standard scope of work includes an investigation phase, something that is not true of structural engineering firms in general.\n\nOld Structures Engineering is dedicated to the idea that old buildings are not only as good as new ones, but can be better because they are cultural artifacts that help inform us all of who and where they are. Preserving and reusing old buildings strengthen our common history by preserving the locations and appearance of our cities and towns, while at the same time saving energy and natural resources by reusing existing built structure rather than demolishing it and building new.","market":"Developed","industry":"Engineering","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental

While they work on many types of projects, the core of Old Structure's practice is the profession of structural engineering. There are many definitions of the field, but they all share several concepts: their work includes analysis and design of buildings and other structures for real-world loads, in order to provide for safe and serviceable use. Because Old Structures works with existing buildings, their analyses often include investigation of existing conditions or failure. In fact, their standard scope of work includes an investigation phase, something that is not true of structural engineering firms in general.\n\nOld Structures Engineering is dedicated to the idea that old buildings are not only as good as new ones, but can be better because they are cultural artifacts that help inform us all of who and where they are. Preserving and reusing old buildings strengthen our common history by preserving the locations and appearance of our cities and towns, while at the same time saving energy and natural resources by reusing existing built structure rather than demolishing it and building new.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Engineering","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"10004","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Conservation engineering, Preservation engineering, Structural engineering, New York, Building restoration, Built environment conservation, Community preservation, Embodied energy, Historic structures, Historic preservation","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1425427200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"91.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"10004","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"NY","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"0de1af7f-e242-5fa2-9616-240ceae3e87a","name":"The Builders Fund","slug":"the-builders-fund","description":"The Builders Fund is a growth-stage private equity fund investing with an impact lens in the intersection of purpose-driven brands and the disruption, and opportunity, created by the need to solve large social and environmental challenges.
