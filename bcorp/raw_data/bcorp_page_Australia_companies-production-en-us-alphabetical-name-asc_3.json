This is broadly broken up into two categories: sustainable architecture, and any other project that directly aligns to the SDGs. Being this specific about who she works with enables her to align with people who have a genuine commitment to the environmental and social impact of what they do. Those who are serious about sustainability; who consider communities; who support local; who are ethical, transparent and fair. Who want to contribute to a better world.\n\nMarnie began her professional life as an environmental scientist. Today, as a photographer she continues to measure her impact. \nShe is B Corp certified, her practice is carbon neutral, and she is a member of 1% for the Planet. Her focus is helping people doing good in their world, and promoting their stories through pitching to her network of press and publications.\n\nIf you're looking for art with a purpose, she has a limited edition fine art print shop that gives back to the environment.

They're savvy raconteurs, telling insightful strategic stories that reflect the unique characteristics of a brand, based on simple truths and insights.

They listen and they encourage their clients to listen as they believe that brands have ears too. Like all storytellers, Mkt. Communications realises it’s in the delivery and without a compelling story, they're out of business. Over the last few years, Mkt. has grown organically, intrinsically passionate about sustainability, we’ve sought out like-minded clients, and they now represent a number of engaging brands who are redefining success in business.

They're savvy raconteurs, telling insightful strategic stories that reflect the unique characteristics of a brand, based on simple truths and insights. They work collaboratively with local and international brands to deliver outstanding work with tangible results. They’re honest. They have courageous conversations with their clients and they sometimes tell them things they don’t want to hear, with great outcomes. They listen and they encourage their clients to listen as they believe that brands have ears too. Like all storytellers, Mkt. Communications realises it’s in the delivery and without a compelling story, they're out of business. Over the last few years, Mkt. has grown organically, intrinsically passionate about sustainability, we’ve sought out like-minded clients, and they now represent a number of engaging brands who are redefining success in business. Mkt. Communications believes step change will happen when the business community embraces the new economy and finds innovative ways of operating in it. As a team, they have set out to break the work-life balance model with a new way of being.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Advertising & market research","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"3182","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Mkt.
