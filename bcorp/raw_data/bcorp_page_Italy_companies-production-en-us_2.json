With its almost complete coverage of the Italian market, every day more than 400,000 consumers buy their products, appreciating their quality and sharing their values.\n\nTheir daily efforts are directed towards employees, customers, consumers and the planet, but also equally towards the community and the local area. They offer nuts and dried fruits, with raw materials having undergone as little processing as possible. Every day they try to provide their employees with an ethical and stimulating environment in which to feel happy and fulfilled. They invest in minimizing packaging waste and in developing more sustainable packaging. They choose customers who share the same values and prefer local suppliers whenever possible. They support the community through projects and training courses on health and proper nutrition.\n\nAt Euro Company they believe that products represent the way in which they convey their values and actions.

To do this, PUR Projet helps these businesses to regenerate, revitalize and preserve the ecosystems upon which they depend. This approach is called \"Insetting.\" PUR Projet designs integrated Insetting programs and projects that incorporate social, economic and environmental compliance and innovation into all types of supply chains, from the farm to final consumer. The objective is to reduce risks and encourage well-managed supply chains. They then work on additional initiatives to strengthen the communities within which we work. Trees and agroforestry are at the heart of PUR Projet activities, as they provide unrivalled ecosystem service benefits. By planting and protecting as many trees as possible, PUR Projet aims to maximize benefits for all stakeholders. By providing the capacity to measure and value the associated ecosystem benefits, PUR is able to prove that trees are the best investment one can make to regenerate our ecosystems and support sustainable livelihood strategies for local communities.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Environmental consulting","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"75011","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Insetting, agroforestry, climate, agroecology, trees, forests, ecosystemic services, supply chains, REDD+, carbon offsetting, PUR Lab, IPI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Brazil","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"China","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Colombia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ethiopia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ghana","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Guatemala","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Honduras","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"India","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Indonesia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Italy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Japan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Madagascar","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Morocco","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New Zealand","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Peru","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Philippines","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Poland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Portugal","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Romania","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Singapore","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Spain","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Switzerland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Thailand","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Arab Emirates","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1459209600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"102.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Île-de-France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"PARIS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"75011","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Abidjan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Addis Ababa","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Central Singapore Community Development Council","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Chiang Mai","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Cundinamarca Department","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Jakarta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ontario","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"San Martín","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Yunnan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Île-de-France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Abidjan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Addis Ababa","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Bogota","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Chiang Mai","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Jakarta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Juan Jui","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Kunming","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"PARIS","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Paris","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Singapour","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Toronto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"2b96be6c-9e5f-56ab-a578-8a339fa6a21e","name":"OPERARI S.R.L.
