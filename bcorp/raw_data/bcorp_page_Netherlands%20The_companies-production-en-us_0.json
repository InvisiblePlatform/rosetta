The company creates a dynamic synergy with customers and supports them through times of dilemma and breakthroughs, through good times and bad times. By surrounding customers with financial expertise and industry knowledge, and, above all, by providing customers with full attention, whenever it is required.\n \nThat philosophy resulted in maintaining solid growth in the challenging Dutch economy over the last couple of years, when many other accounting firms achieved only marginal or negative growth rates. This is an achievement that Alfa is very proud of. Another unique aspect of Alfa is that the company belongs to its employees, which creates a very open and social we-culture within the company. Alfa seeks to become a leading company in the Dutch accounting industry in the field of sustainably and conscious entrepreneurship and to sustain that position through the years.","market":"Developed

The company was founded in 1942 during WWII. Alfa has since grown into a solid company with more than 900 professionals working from 30 offices across the Netherlands.\n \n Alfa excels in providing an excellent customer experience. The company creates a dynamic synergy with customers and supports them through times of dilemma and breakthroughs, through good times and bad times. By surrounding customers with financial expertise and industry knowledge, and, above all, by providing customers with full attention, whenever it is required.\n \nThat philosophy resulted in maintaining solid growth in the challenging Dutch economy over the last couple of years, when many other accounting firms achieved only marginal or negative growth rates. This is an achievement that Alfa is very proud of. Another unique aspect of Alfa is that the company belongs to its employees, which creates a very open and social we-culture within the company. Alfa seeks to become a leading company in the Dutch accounting industry in the field of sustainably and conscious entrepreneurship and to sustain that position through the years.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -

heart of all it does for almost 40 years, taking into account the interest of all our stakeholders, not just shareholders. Alpro’s vision is of a world where more of what we eat comes directly from plants. Why? Because a plant-based lifestyle tastes good in every sense – it’s more sustainable for the planet, and eating more food from plants is good for our health.\n\nBy bringing innovative and tasty plant-based food and drink products to millions of consumers, Alpro is growing its business while tackling the health challenges of both people and the planet, thus creating both economic and social value. For Alpro, every time we eat and drink, we vote for the world we want to live in.\n\nThis vision aligns very well with the vision of our parent company Danone, summarized in Danone, One Planet.

Growing radically good coffee is what they do. Roasting this radically good coffee in the country of origin is how they do it. Sharing the value of this radically good coffee fairly and honestly with the men and women that grow it is why they exist.\n \nSo as you can see, Moyee’s goal isn’t just simply to produce and sell radically good coffee, but also to create radical social change. And because coffee is one of the world’s most popular products, they figured coffee is a great place to start. The supply chain for coffee is broken, and it’s been broken for a long time, but instead of complain about it, Moyee aims to fix it. This is what they’re getting at with their tagline ‘radically good coffee’. It is radically good in terms of its positive impact on the coffee chain.\n \nMoyee calls their philosophy FairChain, which basically means they roast our coffee in the countries that grow our coffee. Sounds trivial maybe, but their farmers earn 300% more than simply exporting green beans to the West. And they earn twice as much as Fairtrade, though they are pushing for more.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Agicultural

Growing radically good coffee is what they do. Roasting this radically good coffee in the country of origin is how they do it. Sharing the value of this radically good coffee fairly and honestly with the men and women that grow it is why they exist.\n \nSo as you can see, Moyee’s goal isn’t just simply to produce and sell radically good coffee, but also to create radical social change. And because coffee is one of the world’s most popular products, they figured coffee is a great place to start. The supply chain for coffee is broken, and it’s been broken for a long time, but instead of complain about it, Moyee aims to fix it. This is what they’re getting at with their tagline ‘radically good coffee’. It is radically good in terms of its positive impact on the coffee chain.\n \nMoyee calls their philosophy FairChain, which basically means they roast our coffee in the countries that grow our coffee. Sounds trivial maybe, but their farmers earn 300% more than simply exporting green beans to the West. And they earn twice as much as Fairtrade, though they are pushing for more.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Agicultural support/post-harvest","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Agriculture/Growers","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"1043 AH","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Ireland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1414108800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"100.6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"North Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"1043 AH","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"County Dublin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"North Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"dublin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"PendingCompanies","id":"752a9a75-f7de-5482-b942-a39cdaa4bf7b","name":"AISU","slug":"a-i-s-u-b-v","description":"Aisu is an Asian inspired ice-cream with respect for Asian culture and a set intention to have a positive impact on our environment.Bragging about a sustainable production process is not our thing.
