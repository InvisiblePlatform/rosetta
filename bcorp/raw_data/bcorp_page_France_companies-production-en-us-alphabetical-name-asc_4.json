On a wider scale, PatteBlanche is involved in educating people about social issues. With conviction and coherence, PatteBlanche seeks to apply a specific set of principles regarding internal processes and project management.\n \nWhile aware that there is still a long way to go, PatteBanche, along with various partners with similar values, is working on tools and projects to foster social-business and continuously improve the company’s impact. For example, external impacts include the development of an incentivising tool for carbon compensation, while internal impacts lie primarily in the construction of new socially responsible premises. Moreover, these new premises constitute a co-working environment that is ready and equipped to welcome new partners and socially responsible freelance workers into a genuine ecosystem. To achieve this objective would be to create an effective ecosystem that can be replicated by other companies.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other info service activities","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"34070","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Communication, Sustainable development, CSR Strategy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1481500800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"93.5","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Montpellier","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"MONTPELLIER","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"34070","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Montpellier","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"MONTPELLIER","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"PendingCompanies","id":"c9b9e166-02b0-5a8d-83c9-0cb4fd93b096","name":"PE Cube","slug":"pe-cube","description":"PE Cube, FinTech created in March 2020, offers a SaaS solution to digitalise Private Equity Firms.\n\nFrom Investors Relations oversee, to Financial Operations management, Performance monitoring, through a close supervision of Portfolio Companies: PE Cube’s solution answers to the needs of Private Equity teams.\n\nBased on 20 years of experience in Private Equity, data-driven, safe and efficient, the cutting-edge solution has been developed following four core principles: openness, sustainability, security, and transparency. \n\nBy helping investors digitalise their activity and comply with increasing regulations, PE Cube aims at being the reference partner for PE Professionals.","market":"Developed -

It is also a way to reset the standards in a rather conservative business such as real estate development. The B-corp label gives Re-Vive a boost to outperform on their impact ambitions.\n \n The mission of Re-Vive in these areas is to develop green spaces and living quarters with a social, demographic and functional mix. Through all projects Re-Vive stimulates neighbourhood participation , the use of public transport and biodiversity. Recycling of demolition materials, the reuse of rainwater, reducing waste and the use of sustainable materials are always included in the project plans. Historically, the legacy problems of such sites have stood in the way of redevelopment with the barrier of reclaiming contaminated sites and regenerating existing buildings proving too complex to resolve. The net result is these sites largely remain undeveloped.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Real estate development","sector":"Service with Significant Environmental

The urban areas have enormous potential to transform themselves into sustainable communities. B Corp certification gives us an objective assessment of the actual realization of Re-Vive's beliefs and a tool to prove they makes things happen. It is also a way to reset the standards in a rather conservative business such as real estate development. The B-corp label gives Re-Vive a boost to outperform on their impact ambitions.\n \n The mission of Re-Vive in these areas is to develop green spaces and living quarters with a social, demographic and functional mix. Through all projects Re-Vive stimulates neighbourhood participation , the use of public transport and biodiversity. Recycling of demolition materials, the reuse of rainwater, reducing waste and the use of sustainable materials are always included in the project plans. Historically, the legacy problems of such sites have stood in the way of redevelopment with the barrier of reclaiming contaminated sites and regenerating existing buildings proving too complex to resolve.

SQUIZ has proven that it's possible to make consumer products locally and profitably. Since their commercial launch, SQUIZ has prevented the creation of over 50 tons of non-recyclable consumer waste through the use of their reusable pouches.\n\n Beginning in the prototype stage, the founders carefully considered the impact of their products in terms of environmental health and the social role of the company they wanted to create. The question was not only: ÒHow would this benefit the company?Ó but especially: ÒWhat benefit could the company bring to others?Ó With strong values deeply rooted in sustainable development as well as social responsibility, SQUIZ seeks to provide ethical products for all ages, to support charitable projects, and to be a driving force in the reduction of household waste.","market":"Developed -

SQUIZ reusable food pouches are the only product of their type, worldwide, to source over 60% of their product cost from local suppliers. SQUIZ has proven that it's possible to make consumer products locally and profitably. Since their commercial launch, SQUIZ has prevented the creation of over 50 tons of non-recyclable consumer waste through the use of their reusable pouches.\n\n Beginning in the prototype stage, the founders carefully considered the impact of their products in terms of environmental health and the social role of the company they wanted to create. The question was not only: ÒHow would this benefit the company?Ó but especially: ÒWhat benefit could the company bring to others?Ó With strong values deeply rooted in sustainable development as well as social responsibility, SQUIZ seeks to provide ethical products for all ages, to support charitable projects, and to be a driving force in the reduction of household waste.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -
