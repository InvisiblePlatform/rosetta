It is simply a piece of iron that you use in the cooking process that releases 75% of your daily-required iron intake and is reusable for up to 5 years. The iron is shaped like a fish, a symbol for luck in Cambodia, the country that inspired this health innovation and where The Lucky Iron Fish Project operates and invests – improving both the health and wealth of Cambodian communities. Everything from the fish itself to the packaging and creative tools are produced in Cambodia using recycled materials and in partnership with local social agencies, NGOs and cooperatives. The Lucy Iron Fish Project will solve a preventable health problem that impacts more than 3.5 billion people worldwide and is responsible of a loss of $70 billion of global GDP. The Lucky Iron Fish™ was invented on the principle of providing Cambodians with a safe effective iron supplement solution that is affordable, accessible, and culturally

In 2006, the group welcomed Michael Davies as winemaker resulting in more collective Oregon winemaking experience for A to Z than any other winery, experience that can make a difference in difficult vintages. Soon after, the families partnered with Gregg Popovich (NBA Head Coach of the San Antonio Spurs) and a few others to buy the 25-year-old property, REX HILL Vineyards and Winery. They reduced REX HILL production by 77%, refining and refocusing the brand to achieve the highest quality and were honored with a Wine Spectator Top 100 Wines of the Year award two years later.\n \nA

They aspire to promote composting in an effective and educational way to engage their local communities to be more sustainable. They feel that food scraps and the other organic components to the waste stream should be considered a natural resource that can be conserved through composting. A key component to their business model has been to “close the loop” through their Compost Credit Program.\n \nNOPE is a proud member of the US & Virginia Compost Council. They have spent years developing Best Managed Practices (BMP’s) through research as well as trial and error. NOPE prides itself as being local, responsive, & engaged with their partners. Their partners include large institutions as well as small sustainable minded local businesses. They believe that that the myriad of small environmental benefits of composting add up to significant environmental & social benefits.\n \nThrough their Compost Credit program they have functionally closed the loop of organic recycling or composting as it is more commonly known. They have returned premium compost for use in school & local community gardens in their service area.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other land transport","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Significant Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"23233","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Compost collection, Organic Recycling, Richmond, VA, Sustainability, Compost, Recycling, Waste diversion, Food Waste, Recycling, Composting, Environmental, Eco-friendly, Stewardship, Hauling, Central & Eastern VA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1401321600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"100.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Virginia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Richmond","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"23233","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"VA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Virginia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Richmond","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"9dd08fae-b7e2-5ad2-ae4d-1cae86b46195","name":"Grove Collaborative Inc.","slug":"grove-collaborative","description":"Grove Collaborative is an online retailer that creates innovative natural products and offers a curated selection of healthy home and personal care essentials.

is the first global platform that allows consumers and businesses to plant trees online and follow the projects they are in. Treedom directly funds farmers worldwide, bringing environmental, social and financial benefits to their communities.\nEvery tree is planted by local farmers and then geolocated and photographed for full transparency of the projects. Each tree has their own individual online pages, enabling users the chance to follow the tree’s story through updates and photos of the project they are a part of. Users can keep the trees they plant or virtually gift them to others.\nThanks to these features, Treedom trees drive high engagement and can be used as effective marketing and communication tools for a growing number of global companies pursuing CSR goals or staff engagement initiatives.\nSince 2010 more than 3 million trees have been planted in 17 countries, supporting over 177,000 farmers. Treedom works with more than 8,000 corporate clients and 985,000 users.\nTreedom headquarters are in Florence, Italy, but it also has offices in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the

businesses to plant trees online and follow the projects they are in. Treedom directly funds farmers worldwide, bringing environmental, social and financial benefits to their communities.\nEvery tree is planted by local farmers and then geolocated and photographed for full transparency of the projects. Each tree has their own individual online pages, enabling users the chance to follow the tree’s story through updates and photos of the project they are a part of. Users can keep the trees they plant or virtually gift them to others.\nThanks to these features, Treedom trees drive high engagement and can be used as effective marketing and communication tools for a growing number of global companies pursuing CSR goals or staff engagement initiatives.\nSince 2010 more than 3 million trees have been planted in 17 countries, supporting over 177,000 farmers. Treedom works with more than 8,000 corporate clients and 985,000 users.\nTreedom headquarters are in Florence, Italy, but it also has offices in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the

They help clients identify what’s really getting in the way of effective teamwork, such as ineffective meetings, unhealthy conflict, and lack of accountability, build the skills to address these challenges, and put a support system in place to maintain improved performance.\n\nShifting Patterns works alongside clients to plan and lead meetings that are participatory, action-oriented, and consistently meet expectations. They help teams articulate their purpose, set goals, develop action plans, and put the structures and processes in place that contribute to effective teamwork. They also work with associations, networks, alliances, and coalitions to define their purpose and membership criteria, conduct stakeholder mapping, and determine how members will work together.  \n\nShifting Patterns has helped social enterprise accelerators, like Ashoka Changemakers, socially responsible business associations, like B Local: Mid-Atlantic Region, and social justice networks, like National Justice for Our Neighbors to determine their strategic direction, strengthen team leadership skills, and improve communication and coordination.","market":"Developed","industry":"Management consultant - nonprofits","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","operatingCountry":"United

The company was founded in 1942 during WWII. Alfa has since grown into a solid company with more than 900 professionals working from 30 offices across the Netherlands.\n \n Alfa excels in providing an excellent customer experience. The company creates a dynamic synergy with customers and supports them through times of dilemma and breakthroughs, through good times and bad times. By surrounding customers with financial expertise and industry knowledge, and, above all, by providing customers with full attention, whenever it is required.\n \nThat philosophy resulted in maintaining solid growth in the challenging Dutch economy over the last couple of years, when many other accounting firms achieved only marginal or negative growth rates. This is an achievement that Alfa is very proud of. Another unique aspect of Alfa is that the company belongs to its employees, which creates a very open and social we-culture within the company. Alfa seeks to become a leading company in the Dutch accounting industry in the field of sustainably and conscious entrepreneurship and to sustain that position through the years.","market":"Developed

The company was founded in 1942 during WWII. Alfa has since grown into a solid company with more than 900 professionals working from 30 offices across the Netherlands.\n \n Alfa excels in providing an excellent customer experience. The company creates a dynamic synergy with customers and supports them through times of dilemma and breakthroughs, through good times and bad times. By surrounding customers with financial expertise and industry knowledge, and, above all, by providing customers with full attention, whenever it is required.\n \nThat philosophy resulted in maintaining solid growth in the challenging Dutch economy over the last couple of years, when many other accounting firms achieved only marginal or negative growth rates. This is an achievement that Alfa is very proud of. Another unique aspect of Alfa is that the company belongs to its employees, which creates a very open and social we-culture within the company. Alfa seeks to become a leading company in the Dutch accounting industry in the field of sustainably and conscious entrepreneurship and to sustain that position through the years.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other business support","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"6708 PV","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"accounting, legal, tax, auditing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1415750400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"114.9","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Gelderland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Wageningen","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"6708 PV","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Gelderland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"not listed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Wageningen","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"8048dd60-9183-522f-8398-182cd884c231","name":"Wallaroo Hat Company","slug":"wallaroo-hat-company","description":"Wallaroo Hat Company, based in Boulder, Colorado was founded in 1991 by Stephanie Carter and Lenya Shore.

Elizabeth was working as a Holistic Health Counselor and was having trouble recommending healthy gluten-free options to her clients. With her background in Integrative Nutrition, she went into the kitchen and began to create baking mixes with alternative nutrient rich flours that were naturally free of gluten and refined sugar.\n \nElizabeth was an active Triathlete at the time and brought her goodies to a race expo to promote her Counseling business. People couldn’t have cared less about her counseling and just wanted her muffins! That was the real aha moment for Elizabeth and Purely Elizabeth was born.\n \nPurely Elizabeth has now since discontinued the muffin mixes and focuses instead on granola and oatmeal made with certified gluten-free oats and organic ancient grains and superfood seeds. We are passionate about using the most superior, high-quality natural and organic ingredients loaded with health benefits and free of the bad stuff.\n   \nAt Purely Elizabeth, they think a healthy food system can be achieved through sustainability and transparency. Only a healthy food system can allow for a healthy planet filled with happy and healthy people.","market":"Developed","industry":"Food products","sector":"Wholesale/Retail","operatingCountry":"United

Elizabeth was working as a Holistic Health Counselor and was having trouble recommending healthy gluten-free options to her clients. With her background in Integrative Nutrition, she went into the kitchen and began to create baking mixes with alternative nutrient rich flours that were naturally free of gluten and refined sugar.\n \nElizabeth was an active Triathlete at the time and brought her goodies to a race expo to promote her Counseling business. People couldn’t have cared less about her counseling and just wanted her muffins! That was the real aha moment for Elizabeth and Purely Elizabeth was born.\n \nPurely Elizabeth has now since discontinued the muffin mixes and focuses instead on granola and oatmeal made with certified gluten-free oats and organic ancient grains and superfood seeds. We are passionate about using the most superior, high-quality natural and organic ingredients loaded with health benefits and free of the bad stuff.\n   \nAt Purely Elizabeth, they think a healthy food system can be achieved through sustainability and transparency.

And there are 250 million cars in Europe alone. Just imagine all the space taken up by these idle chunks of metal. Insane, isnÕt it?\nSnappCar is a fully reliable and user-friendly marketplace, riding the wave of Collaborative Consumption. SnappCar provides an all-risk insurance, handles the payment and resolves any issue that may arise during the rental period to make the user experience as smooth as possible. As a result everybody benefits. Less cars are needed which frees up precious space in cities and reduces CO2 emissions.

Within its community thousands of car owners share their personal cars with tens of thousands of neighbors and friends, all of those looking for a more social, durable and cheaper alternative. SnappCar aims to remove 5 out of 10 cars from our streets in the markets that we are active in.\n \nDid you know that the average car stands still for 23 hours each and every day? And there are 250 million cars in Europe alone. Just imagine all the space taken up by these idle chunks of metal. Insane, isnÕt it?\nSnappCar is a fully reliable and user-friendly marketplace, riding the wave of Collaborative Consumption. SnappCar provides an all-risk insurance, handles the payment and resolves any issue that may arise during the rental period to make the user experience as smooth as possible. As a result everybody benefits. Less cars are needed which frees up precious space in cities and reduces CO2 emissions. Car owners save on their monthly cost, while renters save money by avoiding more expensive alternatives. Finally, it also increases the social cohesion in neighborhoods as people get to know their neighbors.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -
