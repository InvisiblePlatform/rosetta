We seek to create jewellery pieces\nthat combine style and conscience instead of contributing to the culture of\nfast fashion. The brand has in fact set up concrete and transparent\nprocesses:\nIn terms of materials used\n- We use recycled silver and gold in all our jewellery.\n- Pre-loved gemstones and pearls purchased second hand and then cut to\nsize. The reason we opted to do this is that sourcing ethical stones is\ndifficult, in part because there are no established bodies tracing gemstones\nfrom mine to market.\nOn a social level\n·We are very proud to create ethical jewellery for women by women.\nOn an environmental level\n·We use vegan and non-toxic products only in our manufacturing process.\n·We recycle every last scrap of metal whilst making new pieces.\n·Our packaging is plastic free and made of recycled materials.

production and the consumption of organic food through the commercialization of Les 2 Vaches in retail stores. Les 2 Vaches is not only a French organic dairy brand, but also a team of people convinced that the agricultural model can be changed, by providing healthier food for the people and the planet. Since 2006, Les 2 Vaches has been committed to developing strong partnerships with organic farmers, and encourage organic conversions. Year after year, Les 2 Vaches has been working on the quality of their products, by shortening the ingredients list, and being transparent on the ingredients sourcing. Not to mention the cows, for which a welfare program has been created. By embracing a joyful and educational spirit we’ve been increasing awareness of organic and sustainable consumption. Les 2 Vaches is not only an organic dairy company but also a company with a purpose : develop a new alimentation model, with more meaning and transparency and pleasure for
