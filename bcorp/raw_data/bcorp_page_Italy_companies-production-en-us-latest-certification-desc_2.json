The owner, Marcel, believes in respecting nature and in restoring vitality and vigour to the earth, rather than depleting it like most farmers do. His vineyard is located in Bianzone, in Valtellina and his love of nature enables him to produce wonderful wine in this harsh area.\n\nThe diligence of Marcel Zanolari and his father Giuliano permitted the vineyard to grow to 10 hectares of cultivated land with Nebbiolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot nero, Pinot Bianco, Traminer.\n \nBecause of the particular cultivation methods the weather plays a vital role in the growth of grapes, causing a lot of worry. Despite this, Marcel has been able to prove that good results can be obtained by working with passion and respect for nature.

Each tree has their own individual online pages, enabling users the chance to follow the tree’s story through updates and photos of the project they are a part of. Users can keep the trees they plant or virtually gift them to others.\nThanks to these features, Treedom trees drive high engagement and can be used as effective marketing and communication tools for a growing number of global companies pursuing CSR goals or staff engagement initiatives.\nSince 2010 more than 3 million trees have been planted in 17 countries, supporting over 177,000 farmers. Treedom works with more than 8,000 corporate clients and 985,000 users.\nTreedom headquarters are in Florence, Italy, but it also has offices in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the

Each tree has their own individual online pages, enabling users the chance to follow the tree’s story through updates and photos of the project they are a part of. Users can keep the trees they plant or virtually gift them to others.\nThanks to these features, Treedom trees drive high engagement and can be used as effective marketing and communication tools for a growing number of global companies pursuing CSR goals or staff engagement initiatives.\nSince 2010 more than 3 million trees have been planted in 17 countries, supporting over 177,000 farmers.

They use Spark to attract, retain and engage today’s workers by connecting people personally to causes that matter to them. With more than 2 million users around the world, Benevity will process donations benefitting more than 100,000 global charities this year. As a certified B Corporation, Benevity joins a new breed of for-profit companies with a social mission who are setting the standard for doing well by doing good.\n\nBenevity hopes to use their technology through multiple integrations to make giving to the charity of one’s choice as convenient and prevalent as leaving a tip at a restaurant. Benevity envisions a reshaping of the notion and execution of personal and corporate philanthropy that sees it embedded into a variety of everyday consumptive and commercial activities. In such a landscape, people from all demographics – regardless of their means – can give money, time, goods, etc. to the social causes of their choice, while corporations better utilize their resources and influence to do the same in a virtuous circle.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -
