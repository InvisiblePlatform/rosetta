Developing simple yet sophisticated sportswear with unique flag-bearing sweatshirts, the brand skyrocketed to success creating âA Spirt of Unificationâ, selling clothing and uniting people around the world.\n \nMondetta has evolved from a sportswear brand to a global leader in sustainable, technical lifestyle and activewear. The Company has grown exponentially and today has 3 divisions: direct-to-consumer, wholesale and private label, and maintains a vast supply chain comprised of facilities spanning 13 countries. Despite its growth and success, Mondetta has remained committed to its core values: high-quality product, value and accessibility, ethical business practices and continuous evolution, and is dedicated to reaching the highest level of social, economic and environmental responsibility by constantly improving its business model to reduce its environmental footprint and implement socially responsible practices\n \nIn 2004 the Mondetta Charity Foundation was established as a means to give back.

And it's a serious problem. From the top of Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and literally everywhere in between, microplastics are polluting the environment, wildlife and our bodies with toxic, synthetic chemicals. Life Without Plastic began in 2006 when pioneering co-founders Chantal and Jay couldn't find non-plastic products for their basic needs. The company offers safe, high quality, ethically-sourced and Earth-friendly alternatives to plastics for everyday life, including zero waste essentials. Life Without Plastic is a mission-based business actively working for positive social change, improved health, and environmental sustainability. Products are carefully designed and sourced from vetted and trusted suppliers. Building awareness and catalyzing positive action at individual and systemic levels are key elements of the Life Without Plastic mission. The co-founders' bestselling book - Life Without Plastic: The Practical Step-by-Step Guide to Avoiding Plastic to Keep Your Family and the Planet Healthy - distils their years of plastics research and their experience running the company into an easily understandable deep dive on the plastic pollution issue with plenty of tips and tools for living with less plastic.

These investments are made in North American-based businesses that Investeco believes to have some or all of the following characteristics: environmental benefits, established revenues, strong growth prospects, excellent management and long-term competitive advantages, as well as the prospect of providing a profitable exit opportunity within 4 to 7 years from the date of initial investment.

These investments are made in North American-based businesses that Investeco believes to have some or all of the following characteristics: environmental benefits, established revenues, strong growth prospects, excellent management and long-term competitive advantages, as well as the prospect of providing a profitable exit opportunity within 4 to 7 years from the date of initial investment.

Our food is made using organic ingredients and is free from allergens, refined sugar and preservatives. Thatâs not all, every time you buy our products, we donate money to feed someone in need. Our offering includes ketchups, BBQ sauces, fresh cooking sauces and turmeric teas. Our products are available across Canada and US and are sold under brand names Good Food For Good and Turmeric Teas.\n\nThe company was founded by Richa Gupta, a marketer and mother of a 12 year old girl. As a working mother, Richa found it very challenging to find packaged food and prepared shortcuts that met her expectations for taste and ingredient quality. Frustrated with being forced to compromise quality for convenience, Richa launched Good Foor For Good to make it easy for every one to eat well and do good. Inspired by TOMS Shoes, Richa adopted the Buy One Feed One model for her food business. Richa is proud to have made a positive difference in over 600,000 meals and is actively working on reaching her goal of feeding 1 million people every year.","market":"Developed -

Our food is made using organic ingredients and is free from allergens, refined sugar and preservatives. Thatâs not all, every time you buy our products, we donate money to feed someone in need. Our offering includes ketchups, BBQ sauces, fresh cooking sauces and turmeric teas. Our products are available across Canada and US and are sold under brand names Good Food For Good and Turmeric Teas.\n\nThe company was founded by Richa Gupta, a marketer and mother of a 12 year old girl. As a working mother, Richa found it very challenging to find packaged food and prepared shortcuts that met her expectations for taste and ingredient quality. Frustrated with being forced to compromise quality for convenience, Richa launched Good Foor For Good to make it easy for every one to eat well and do good. Inspired by TOMS Shoes, Richa adopted the Buy One Feed One model for her food business. Richa is proud to have made a positive difference in over 600,000 meals and is actively working on reaching her goal of feeding 1 million people every year.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food

Our values of health, sustainability and community are an important part of everything that we do and the best part, they were inspired by you. By creating products with purpose, we are able to do well by doing good for both people and the planet. Our range of all natural products includes Coconut Bowls (3 sizes), Bamboo Cups,Wooden Cutlery, Coconut Candles, Plant Based Cookbooks, Zero Waste Market Bags and more.\n\nWe reimagined the waste streams of the coconut tree and realised itâs one of the most sustainable plants on the planet. Our sustainable commitment started with natural waste streams and has since been baked into everything we do and everyone we interact with. From securing economic and social sustainability with families and farmers in rural Vietnam to ensuring our products are sustainably packaged and our carbon footprint is offset. Beyond this weâre committed to sustainable business practices as a member of 1% for the Planet.\nLet's connect and work together to create positive impact.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -
