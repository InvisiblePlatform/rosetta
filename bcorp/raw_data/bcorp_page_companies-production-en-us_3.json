In less than four years, the company, a family-owned business operated by Peralta and his wife Carla Barbotó, has revolutionized the industry in both Ecuador and Latin America by creating a transparent model of tree-to-bar manufacturing based on innovation, ecological and social responsibility, and direct trade with certified organic farms throughout the country. \n\n Peralta and his company benefit more than 3,500 farming families. “We are intimately connected to cacao farmers and their needs, and we work with them in many important ways: to help them improve cacao yields, in implementing programs of organic and biodynamic certification, even creating a school of organic agriculture (COLEGIO CEFA),” Peralta explains. “Sometimes our help might seem intangible like buying donkeys for a disabled farmer to ease his work load, or reducing the weight of cacao bags so that women can carry these bags more easily to local markets, but these small things also matter and are proof of our commitment to a direct model of interaction that puts the farmer first.”","market":"Emerging","industry":"Agricultural

mission: to change the history of chocolate in his native country. In less than four years, the company, a family-owned business operated by Peralta and his wife Carla Barbotó, has revolutionized the industry in both Ecuador and Latin America by creating a transparent model of tree-to-bar manufacturing based on innovation, ecological and social responsibility, and direct trade with certified organic farms throughout the country. \n\n Peralta and his company benefit more than 3,500 farming families. “We are intimately connected to cacao farmers and their needs, and we work with them in many important ways: to help them improve cacao yields, in implementing programs of organic and biodynamic certification, even creating a school of organic agriculture (COLEGIO CEFA),” Peralta explains. “Sometimes our help might seem intangible like buying donkeys for a disabled farmer to ease his work load, or reducing the weight of cacao bags so that women can carry these bags more easily to local markets, but these small things also matter and are proof of our commitment to a direct model of interaction that puts the farmer first.”","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Emerging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Agricultural

They rescue the “too-wonky” & “too-many” direct from farmers to doorsteps all around London & the South East. They help the community make a difference to the planet each week - fighting food waste at farm-level, avoiding CO2e and saving water along the way.\n\nThey first launched in 2016, with their two founders, Emilie & Deepak, packing fruit & veg in a small area in South-West London. Since then, they’ve grown all across the South-East with plans to go nationwide, bringing in even more people to eat good, do good, and stay odd.\n\nThey’re incredibly proud to support farmers and growers.

Unlike traditional student lenders, they fundamentally align the interest of their investors and students in a win-win relationship that benefits everyone. Lumni's investment funds don't make loans. Instead, students commit a fixed percentage of income for the 10 years after they graduate. This dramatically reduces the risk of unmanageable payments after graduation in the case of unemployment or underemployment, giving debt-averse, underserved college students the comfort to take a leap.\n\nLumni also employs an innovative underwriting process, determining creditworthiness not on access to co-signer like traditional lenders, but instead on a student's personal drive and potential. This allows Lumni to identify qualified clients from with the country's most underserved populations, students who would be deemed too risky by private lenders. Finally, Lumni distinguishes itself by building a relationship with its students and supporting them with career coaching and development services.","market":"Emerging","industry":"Other credit -

Unlike traditional student lenders, they fundamentally align the interest of their investors and students in a win-win relationship that benefits everyone. Lumni's investment funds don't make loans. Instead, students commit a fixed percentage of income for the 10 years after they graduate. This dramatically reduces the risk of unmanageable payments after graduation in the case of unemployment or underemployment, giving debt-averse, underserved college students the comfort to take a leap.\n\nLumni also employs an innovative underwriting process, determining creditworthiness not on access to co-signer like traditional lenders, but instead on a student's personal drive and potential. This allows Lumni to identify qualified clients from with the country's most underserved populations, students who would be deemed too risky by private lenders. Finally, Lumni distinguishes itself by building a relationship with its students and supporting them with career coaching and development services.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Emerging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other credit - Emerging Markets","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"7510004","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"higher education financing college university student graduate career coaching chile lender loan financimiento investment future latin america low-income risky capital tuition fee","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1345766400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"92.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Santiago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Santiago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"7510004","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Santiago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"not listed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Santiago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"954daa5b-eeb8-5bcd-9815-64a7f35c3934","name":"Terra Education, Inc.","slug":"terra-education-inc","description":"Terra Education offers diversified educational programs that span the world. \n\nGlobal Leadership Adventures  (GLA)  is a leading international community service summer program for high school aged students.

Olivia Fussell, CCC’s managing director, is also a frequent speaker on carbon and clean energy markets.\n \n In 2015, CCC began the Carbon Neutral Checkout™, an opportunity for firms to go completely carbon-neutral at little to no cost. CCC calculates a firm’s carbon footprint associated with the numerous supply-chain stages and offers offsets to neutralize the footprint. The cost is passed on to the end customers and there are no additional costs to the company.\n \nCarbon Credit Capital’s (CCC) mission is dedicated to combating climate change and helping businesses and individuals mitigate carbon emissions. Unlike big corporations, CCC recognizes that not every individual, institution, or business has the necessary acumen or resources to make meaningful impact.","market":"Developed","industry":"Environmental consulting","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","operatingCountry":"United States","operatingProvince":"New

Olivia Fussell, CCC’s managing director, is also a frequent speaker on carbon and clean energy markets.\n \n In 2015, CCC began the Carbon Neutral Checkout™, an opportunity for firms to go completely carbon-neutral at little to no cost. CCC calculates a firm’s carbon footprint associated with the numerous supply-chain stages and offers offsets to neutralize the footprint. The cost is passed on to the end customers and there are no additional costs to the company.\n \nCarbon Credit Capital’s (CCC) mission is dedicated to combating climate change and helping businesses and individuals mitigate carbon emissions. Unlike big corporations, CCC recognizes that not every individual, institution, or business has the necessary acumen or resources to make meaningful
