Faro's customers save on energy bills, reduce energy price volatility and increase independence from the grid. Faro's investors benefit from stable, long term returns on their investment.\n\nFaro Energy partners with a network of local engineers and developers across the region, bringing together the best local knowledge and engineering skills with international capital and solar expertise.\n \nFaro Energy was known as Iwana Energy until June 2016\n \nFaro Energy aims to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy, by bringing innovative solar financing models to new markets.\n \nIn many emerging markets, solar is already cost-competitive with grid power without subsidy. However, most energy consumers (of all sizes) want to pay for their energy as they use it rather than incurring large upfront costs. This makes lack of access to capital is one of the biggest barriers to rapid roll-out of solar.\n \nUltimately, Faro aims to catalyse a large scale shift in global capital flows to a low carbon economy, by creating attractive, large scale investment opportunities - turning clean energy infrastructure in developing countries into a mainstream investment

Faro's customers save on energy bills, reduce energy price volatility and increase independence from the grid. Faro's investors benefit from stable, long term returns on their investment.\n\nFaro Energy partners with a network of local engineers and developers across the region, bringing together the best local knowledge and engineering skills with international capital and solar expertise.\n \nFaro Energy was known as Iwana Energy until June 2016\n \nFaro Energy aims to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy, by bringing innovative solar financing models to new markets.\n \nIn many emerging markets, solar is already cost-competitive with grid power without subsidy. However, most energy consumers (of all sizes) want to pay for their energy as they use it rather than incurring large upfront costs. This makes lack of access to capital is one of the biggest barriers to rapid roll-out of solar.\n \nUltimately, Faro aims to catalyse a large scale shift in global capital flows to a low carbon economy, by creating attractive, large scale investment opportunities - turning clean energy infrastructure in developing countries into a mainstream investment asset.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Emerging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Solar panel installation","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Significant Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Brazil","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"CEP 04601-070","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Solar, Renewable Energy, Latin America, Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Central America","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Brazil","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1459900800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"99.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Brazil","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"SP","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"São Paulo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"CEP 04601-070","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"SP","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"not listed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"São Paulo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"1cbb9fe2-799f-5c03-8f90-e055e4f4ea2e","name":"Mejor en Bici","slug":"mejor-en-bici","description":"Mejor en Bici's mission is to improve the quality of life by promoting bicycle use as the mode of transportation in the city and make people fall in love with its use.

The firm's founder, Deb Wetherby, wanted to create a new model that rewarded objectivity and results and eschewed the product and sales-driven culture present in most firms at that time. She made the decision to separate fees from investment recommendations, a novel idea that became the industry standard. Wetherby has no internal products and prides itself on offering objective investment advice to clients. \n \nGrowth of the firm has been centered on the founding values of independence, objectivity and exceptional client service. These tenets were especially crucial in Wetherby's early embrace of impact investing, enabling the firm to be flexible and respond to client demand for investments that could align their portfolio with their values. Wetherby is dedicated to ensuring these founding principles remain part of the firm's culture into the future thus our owners periodically offers key employees the opportunity to become owners of the business.","market":"Developed","industry":"Investment advising","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","operatingCountry":"United

The firm's founder, Deb Wetherby, wanted to create a new model that rewarded objectivity and results and eschewed the product and sales-driven culture present in most firms at that time. She made the decision to separate fees from investment recommendations, a novel idea that became the industry standard. Wetherby has no internal products and prides itself on offering objective investment advice to clients. \n \nGrowth of the firm has been centered on the founding values of independence, objectivity and exceptional client service. These tenets were especially crucial in Wetherby's early embrace of impact investing, enabling the firm to be flexible and respond to client demand for investments that could align their portfolio with their values. Wetherby is dedicated to ensuring these founding principles remain part of the firm's culture into the future thus our owners periodically offers key employees the opportunity to become owners of the business.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Investment advising","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"94104","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1461801600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"120.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"San Francisco","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"94104","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Los Angeles","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"San Francisco","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"12e71b2c-d95c-58dc-981e-c036334b55b6","name":"MuLondon","slug":"mulondon","description":"MuLondon brings joy and balance with its award-winning skin care range from London, inspired by traditional herbalism.

The Stroopie Co. has two main goals as a social enterprise:To support refugees who are starting over in Lancaster by providing meaningful employment.To make high quality Stroopies to sell in Lancaster and all over the US.\n \n Currently, there are 60 million refugees world wide who have been forced to flee their countries due to war, natural disasters, and drought. Each year Lancaster City invites approx. 700 of these dear folks to get re-established in new homes. In addition to the turbulent and often-traumatic path to come to the United States, many refugees face a difficult time finding employment once they are resettled in Lancaster due to language and cultural barriers.\n \n The Stroopie Co., was founded with the goal of producing top notch Stroopies, while make a difference to the refugee population that is resettling in Lancaster.\n \n So what is a Stroopie? A Stroopie is a Dutch stroopwafel. It is a cinnamon cookie, made with a waffle iron with a layer of homemade caramel in the inside. Traditionally, the Stroopie is placed on top of your hot beverage to rewarm.

They believe that they can inspire a new group of consumers to tackle the environmental issues we are now faced with head on, positively impacting our future. They work with a variety of not-for-profits, educational groups, and organizations across the globe to ensure that their planting efforts are having a real, marked impact in the local communities. To date, they have already planted over 25 million trees and have a goal to plant 1 billion trees by 2030.\n\nWith millions of trees planted to date, the impact is easy to see. These trees have provided hundreds of thousands of days of employment in underprivileged communities across the globe which equates to several hundred full-time jobs. Not to mention the countless hours of education that have gone into making these projects a success. The environmental impact is truly astounding as these trees help rejuvenate damaged eco-systems and remove pollution from the atmosphere. With every purchase this impact grows.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -

These recycled raw materials are then used to produce eco-products such as clothing, beddings, and other everyday textile products. DA.AI’s production process has received a “Global Recycling Standard” (“GRS”) certification from the Netherland’s Peterson Control Union. In order to gain GRS process certification, all stages of production, from obtaining raw materials to manufacturing and trading of the products have to be in compliance with the GRS

They believe that architecture is an important tool in the creation of community, the way they interact with and create places, and the way people engage with each other. Dunn & Hillam Architects follow three basic principles in everything they do.\n \nIt's the people that matter: Great clients, great staff, great consultants and collaborators make great projects. Architecture is for people and should benefit those inside it and those around it.\n \nGood design is sustainable design: A building doesn’t have to flag itself as sustainable. Dunn & Hillam believe in building smaller but better as the most important move towards sustainable architecture. Sustainability is always in environmental, economic and social terms.\n \nArchitecture is not a consumer object: Architecture should not become obsolete or out of fashion. It should work with the past and with the future to contribute to our cities, towns and landscapes in ways that are lasting and positive. Architecture is spatial and three dimensional and its success is based more on how it makes you feel than on how it looks.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Architecture design &

They believe that architecture is an important tool in the creation of community, the way they interact with and create places, and the way people engage with each other. Dunn & Hillam Architects follow three basic principles in everything they do.\n \nIt's the people that matter: Great clients, great staff, great consultants and collaborators make great projects. Architecture is for people and should benefit those inside it and those around it.\n \nGood design is sustainable design: A building doesn’t have to flag itself as sustainable. Dunn & Hillam believe in building smaller but better as the most important move towards sustainable architecture. Sustainability is always in environmental, economic and social terms.\n \nArchitecture is not a consumer object: Architecture should not become obsolete or out of fashion. It should work with the past and with the future to contribute to our cities, towns and landscapes in ways that are lasting and positive. Architecture is spatial and three dimensional and its success is based more on how it makes you feel than on how it looks.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -
