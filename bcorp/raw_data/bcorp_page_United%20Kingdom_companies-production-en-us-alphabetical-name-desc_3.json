That’s why we keep our coffee range straightforward and perfectly formed (because let’s face it, you have better things to do than read bean gradings). We offer coffee for every kind of drinker wherever they are on their coffee journey, from instant to beans and everything in between, so you can always find your usual or change up your game. When it comes to flavours, ours aren’t complicated or fancy - they’re simply ones you recognise. We're working hard to continuously minimise our impact, sourcing our coffee from carefully selected farmers, working with respected organisations, including Rainforest Alliance, and reducing our environmental impact through dedicated actions such as making 100% of our packaging 100% recyclable.\nPresto.

Our aim is to facilitate change, rather than consult in the traditional sense. \n\nTo do so, our team of engineers, environmental scientists and consultants, each experts in their respective fields, take an incremental approach to problem solving; breaking down complex challenges to drive actionable change. \n\nAs sustainability is a journey and not an end goal in itself, our work is inherently iterative and circular. Rather than fixating on reaching an end state, our main focus lies on knowledge and capacity building as well as practical advice. This ranges from benchmarking exercises to implementation and integration of sustainability principles into organisational DNA.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Management  consultant - for-profits","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"3012KP","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Sustainability Consultant, Certification Expert, Sustainability facilitator, sustainability strategy; Sustainability reporting; ESG Annual Report","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Austria","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Bangladesh","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Belgium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Czech Republic","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Denmark","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Finland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Greece","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Hong Kong S.A.R.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Hungary","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Iceland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ireland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Israel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Italy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Liechtenstein","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Lithuania","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Luxembourg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Monaco","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Norway","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Poland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Portugal","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Romania","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sweden","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Switzerland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Arab Emirates","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1568160000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"84.9","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"South Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Rotterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"3012KP","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"South Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Rotterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"2ce8e933-1d91-569d-905f-9ca5fd2180e6","name":"Newyonder","slug":"newyonder","description":"Newyonder is a producer and distributor of cinematic film and television.\n\nAs a media and entertainment company, global streaming service and B Corp, Newyonder is dedicated to leaving our planet wilder, more biodiverse and sustainable, through storytelling, optimism and change.

They have over 40 self-catering houses (and growing). Each is presented with something special and quirky enough to tempt people away from flying and into staycations. Under 45% of holiday houses are accepted into the business. \n\nThe brand focuses on redefining 'luxury' away from 1980's ideals and into a modern, integral meaning, including the basics: local, and seasonal. Inspiring 'education touch-points' are crafted into all communications to encourage people into future-focused, climate-friendly behaviours. \nOwners are encouraged to green-up their houses and support local businesses. Guests are encouraged to immerse themselves in the slow/local life, embrace nature, and support sustainability-goals on their travels. The brand gives particular emphasis to inspiring people through story-telling; interviewing local food heroes and spending-green. \n\nThe directors believe that the business is an effective platform to catalyse and lead change, and often the first to roll their sleeves up and get involved. Our future vision is collaborative, upbeat and positive.

Nestled on the wild and beautiful Morvern peninsula on the west coast of Scotland, Nc'nean is powered solely by renewable energy and in 2021 became verified as net zero for scopes 1 & 2 by Environmental Strategies Limited. This made them the first whisky distillery in the UK to receive the net zero verification. Founded by Annabel Thomas back in 2013, who's mission was to create a whisky which could exist in harmony with the planet, Nc'nean is uninhibited by tradition. The team focus on making small batch spirits, using innovation to seek out unique and delicious flavours in whisky making. \n\nThe name, pronounced Nc-nee-an, is an abbreviation of Neachneohain, an ancient Gaelic goddess. She was a protector of nature, a huntress and was never afraid to walk her own path. Nc'nean follow her ethos in everything they do.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Beverages","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"PA80 5XZ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"ncnean,nc'nean,whisky,spirits,scotch,organic,renewable,net zero,distillery","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1640822400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"135.6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Highland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Drimnin, By Lochaline","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"PA80 5XZ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Highland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Drimnin, By Lochaline","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"6d7d10e5-fd1c-5af3-872a-3a4424807ec5","name":"Natura &Co","slug":"natura-co","description":"Natura &Co is a global, purpose-driven, multi-channel, and multi-brand cosmetics group which includes Avon, Natura, The Body Shop, and Aesop.
