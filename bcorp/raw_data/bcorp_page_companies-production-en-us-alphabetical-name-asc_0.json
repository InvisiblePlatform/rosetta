To deliver //3877 begins with a very simple process: ask questions and listen carefully to the answers.  They want to understand the needs, wishes and desires of each client in order to impactfully use architecture and design to address each aspiration. Their passion is minimizing their impact on the natural environment while maximizing the impact on their clients’ built environment. \n\nThe concepts of partnership and team are very important to us at //3877.

Quality, durability, performance, and necessity are our enduring values due to the near-mythical challenges of the unpredictable Icelandic climate and because, as a small nation, our customers have always been our friends, family, and neighbors.

is an Asian inspired ice-cream with respect for Asian culture and a set intention to have a positive impact on our environment.Bragging about a sustainable production process is not our thing. We believe, in this day and age, it should go without saying that we are conscious and considerate of our environment in everything we do. We rather boast about our mouthwatering flavours and surprising textures.We’re happy to be a part of a growing food category. Plant based dairy products are popping up everywhere. More vegan options makes it so much easier for consumers to choose a plant based treat more often. Veganism is the most straightforward way to contribute to a sustainable future and decrease our global footprint, considering the dairy industry and livestock farming are big polluters.Unmeltable ice cream has yet to be invented.

Therefore, to best serve the interests of their clients, integrating ESG factors is a key element of AKO’s investment approach.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Investment advising","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"W1S 2GB","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"AKO, AKO Capital","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1611792000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"95.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"W1S 2GB","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"198983b3-b295-586b-9d89-5892f920dc54","name":"AKOMA","slug":"akoma-international-uk-limited","description":"At Akoma, we do business in a way that's good for everybody.\nFrom the start of our production process, right to the moment when you're using one of our fabulous products, you can be satisfied that we've thought about our workers, the environment, and you every step of the way.\nOur raw shea butter, palm oil, coconut oil, cocoa butter and black soap products are produced in cooperatives in Ghana, using traditional methods that don't harm the environment, producing 100% organic products.

Alfa seeks to become a leading company in the Dutch accounting industry in the field of sustainably and conscious entrepreneurship and to sustain that position through the years.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other business support","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"6708 PV","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"accounting, legal, tax, auditing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1415750400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"114.9","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Gelderland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Wageningen","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"6708 PV","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Gelderland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"not listed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Wageningen","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"c7564e84-07cf-5b08-a1da-52cc38ef8223","name":"AlgaEnergy, S.A.","slug":"alga-energy-s-a","description":"AlgaEnergy is a biotechnology-based company specialized in the science of microalgae.

AllCare Health is led by Southern Oregon physicians, many of whom have been working together to serve Oregonians since 1994. For the more than 50,000 current members enrolled in various AllCare Health plans throughout the state, this means simpler, more efficient care delivered by a network of dedicated healthcare providers.\n \nAllCare Health is dedicated to giving back to the community. We actively pursue and invest in the social determinants of health, including programs that support transitional and low-income housing, childhood nutrition, early childhood education, and improving access to healthcare. As a good neighbor, we understand that building a healthy community is about more than just doctor visits.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other human health","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"97526","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"AllCare Health, Health insurance, Medicaid, Community Investment, Southern Oregon, IPA, AllCare, Medicare","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1501545600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"119.3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Oregon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Grants Pass","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"97526","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"OR","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Oregon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Brookings","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Grants Pass","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Medford","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"7b24a845-03c4-5a52-a09e-5f50f75c0aa0","name":"Alliant International University","slug":"alliant-international-university","description":"Alliant University has been preparing students for a wide variety of professional careers for more than 90 years.
