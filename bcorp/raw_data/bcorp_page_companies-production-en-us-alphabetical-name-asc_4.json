The company helps clients avoid profiting from the exploitation of people and the environment, while working with clients and their capital to press for a healthier, more sustainable society.\n \nA pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing (SRI), Clean Yield began in 1985 as a stock-market newsletter that provided buy and sell advice on socially and financially screened securities. Subscribers could avoid tobacco, alcohol, gambling, pornography, weapons, nuclear power, defense contractors, and a number of other areas of concern. Instead, they could direct their investments toward companies with products and services making positive social contributions. Within two years, the principals formed Clean Yield Asset Management, which serves SRI clients by buying and selling securities on their behalf. Clean Yield’s services also include community investing, slow-money investing, and “shareholder activism”—i.e., using the ownership of a company’s shares for leverage in advancing corporate responsibility.","market":"Developed","industry":"Investment advising","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","operatingCountry":"United

social impact. The company helps clients avoid profiting from the exploitation of people and the environment, while working with clients and their capital to press for a healthier, more sustainable society.\n \nA pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing (SRI), Clean Yield began in 1985 as a stock-market newsletter that provided buy and sell advice on socially and financially screened securities. Subscribers could avoid tobacco, alcohol, gambling, pornography, weapons, nuclear power, defense contractors, and a number of other areas of concern. Instead, they could direct their investments toward companies with products and services making positive social contributions. Within two years, the principals formed Clean Yield Asset Management, which serves SRI clients by buying and selling securities on their behalf. Clean Yield’s services also include community investing, slow-money investing, and “shareholder activism”—i.e., using the ownership of a company’s shares for leverage in advancing corporate responsibility.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Investment

We're creating positive changes to the way we consume food by replacing single use plastics with all natural, sustainably sourced, eco friendly and regenerative products. Our values of health, sustainability and community are an important part of everything that we do and the best part, they were inspired by you. By creating products with purpose, we are able to do well by doing good for both people and the planet. Our range of all natural products includes Coconut Bowls (3 sizes), Bamboo Cups,Wooden Cutlery, Coconut Candles, Plant Based Cookbooks, Zero Waste Market Bags and more.\n\nWe reimagined the waste streams of the coconut tree and realised it’s one of the most sustainable plants on the planet.

Coffee Circle personally sources coffees with strict principles, pays prices far above the world market and regularly visits the farmer cooperatives to build up personal relationships. Roasted in Berlin, Coffee Circle sells across Europe to private, corporate and wholesale customers mainly through its website coffeecircle.com\n\nCoffee Circle further invests 1 EUR per kg of roasted coffee sold, into projects at the grower communities to improve living conditions of the farmers and their families. The funds are invested with the goal to maximize social impact in the areas of health, education and agricultural training.\n\nCoffee Circle understands these development projects not as charitable giving, but as compensation for the high quality coffee its suppliers produce. That underlines the company’s belief in Entrepreneurship to be a key driver for economic development and social change in underprivileged countries in Africa and South America.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Agricultural Processing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Agriculture/Growers","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"13347","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Coffee Circle, Organic Coffee Germany, Coffee Berlin, Direct Trade Coffee","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Ethiopia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1464652800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"97.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Berlin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Berlin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"13347","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Berlin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Berlin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"04039cc2-497b-5a33-b83c-56f27c7a4f76","name":"Coffee Collective","slug":"coffee-collective","description":"The Coffee Collective is a Copenhagen-based micro roastery with four coffee shops, wholesale partnerships and an international webshop.\n\nA strong set of values powers their overall purpose: To create exciting coffee experiences that bring better returns to the farmer.\n\nThrough long-term relationships with farmers they work for creating financial sustainability with transparency in pricing at the core. \n\nDealing directly with farmers with annual visits, paying higher prices, and publishing those prices directly on the bags have been key instruments in creating transparency in a non-transparent market.\n\nAt the other end of the chain, their baristas are part of a union agreement (3F) and wind energy powers their coffee shops, reducing the CO2 footprint by up to 40%. \n\nTheir yearly Sustainability Report was the first step towards B Corp Certification and the next step is to continuously improve their impact on the world in general and coffee in particular. \n\nOverall, the Coffee Collective pursues to be sustainable in a broad sense.

Their goal is to make coffee-growing a sustainable and beneficial endeavor for farmer families and their communities.\n\nCooperative Coffees was founded in 1999 with a desire to make a positive change in the world of coffee.

With its affiliate PHI, CHCA responds to these challenges by providing free training and guaranteed, high-quality employment for hundreds of women each year.\n \nRecognizing that many participants face significant, compound barriers to employment, CHCA’s workforce development program provides comprehensive home health training with guaranteed jobs for graduates, targeted mentoring, and a range of supports to help individuals effectively address both professional and personal challenges as they transition to work.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Home health care","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Significant Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"10458","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Worker cooperative, Co-ops, Direct care workforce, Adult learner-centered training, Entry-level development, Bronx, NY,new york city nyc Coaching consulting services, curriculum Home care health healthcare jobs women employment CHCA PHI elderly disability","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1339632000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"140.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Bronx","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"10458","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"NY","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Bronx","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"2167cf2a-063a-55c3-ba86-7040d6b81941","name":"Cooperative Mu","slug":"cooperative-mu","description":"Mu is an eco-design agency that guides its clients to enhance their products and services’ eco-efficiency.
