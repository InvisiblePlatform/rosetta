1986, entrepreneur Allan English discovered a new style of pizza oven in the US.  Back in Australia, hospitality businesses wanted the ovens but struggled to find the capital to buy them. Facing disaster, Allan had a brainwave – he offered the pizza ovens to rent so that customers could try them before committing.  This was the birth of SilverChef and the Rent-Try-Buy® product we offer today. The experience of giving hospitality entrepreneurs a helping hand eventually led to SilverChef’s purpose of helping people achieve their dreams in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and around the

Back in Australia, hospitality businesses wanted the ovens but struggled to find the capital to buy them. Facing disaster, Allan had a brainwave – he offered the pizza ovens to rent so that customers could try them before committing.

The experience of giving hospitality entrepreneurs a helping hand eventually led to SilverChef’s purpose of helping people achieve their dreams in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and around the world.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other financial services","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"4101","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Finance, Hospitality, Cafe, Restaurant, Food, Bar","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New Zealand","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1435017600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"86.8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Queensland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Brisbane","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"4101","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Auckland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"British Columbia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"QLD","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Queensland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Victoria","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Auckland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Brisbane","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Melbourne","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Vancourver","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Wacol","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"1e4b9dc3-d35a-5f17-840c-ce69aa42ea99","name":"Straightup Solar, LLC","slug":"straightup-solar-llc","description":"StraightUp Solar is a solar energy integration company.

2012 Ethique started making unique formulas from their kitchen in Christchurch, New Zealand. With their knowledge of chemistry & biology Ethique wanted to create better cosmetics & they weren’t afraid to do things differently.\n \nEthique has now outgrown the kitchen and set up in their lab. But their core guiding principle remains the same: healthy products, made with sustainable, naturally derived ingredients. \n \nEthique was started because hair & skin care needed a shake up: simple, concentrated & sustainable products that deliver on results, without the packaging.\n \nBars are the answer – no bottles, no harsh chemicals, just good things in high concentration. They're all about taking beauty products & making them super dense. Each bar is packed full of only good things that will work to bring out the best in your skin & hair.\n \nWhy bars?\nSolid cosmetics have loads of benefits. They last for ages because they’re so concentrated – one bar of Ethique can last as long as five bottles of its liquid relative. And because there’s no water, Ethique doesn’t contain preservatives. ‘First do no harm’ is Ethique's priority, and they do that by making solid formulas.\n \nFor Ethique, sustainability runs deep. They started making beauty products because they know they can be made better.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Personal care products","sector":"Manufacturing","operatingCountry":"New

With their knowledge of chemistry & biology Ethique wanted to create better cosmetics & they weren’t afraid to do things differently.\n \nEthique has now outgrown the kitchen and set up in their lab. But their core guiding principle remains the same: healthy products, made with sustainable, naturally derived ingredients. \n \nEthique was started because hair & skin care needed a shake up: simple, concentrated & sustainable products that deliver on results, without the packaging.\n \nBars are the answer – no bottles, no harsh chemicals, just good things in high concentration. They're all about taking beauty products & making them super dense. Each bar is packed full of only good things that will work to bring out the best in your skin & hair.\n \nWhy bars?\nSolid cosmetics have loads of benefits. They last for ages because they’re so concentrated – one bar of Ethique can last as long as five bottles of its liquid relative. And because there’s no water, Ethique doesn’t contain preservatives. ‘First do no harm’ is Ethique's priority, and they do that by making solid formulas.\n \nFor Ethique, sustainability runs deep. They started making beauty products because they know they can be made better.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Personal care products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"New Zealand","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"8042","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"sustainability cosmetics new zealand beauty","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"New Zealand","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1436227200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"117.9","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"New Zealand","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Canterbury","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Christchurch","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"8042","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CAN","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canterbury","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Christchurch","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"d5d8ba6f-e35b-5a34-8920-bcccb4a9747c","name":"Aggelos","slug":"aggelos","description":"Aggelos is a communication experts’ tribe!\n \nThey engage in any communication project with curiosity and enthusiasm, with a special care to let everyone involved thrive.

We believe a person’s portfolio is an important extension of their values. In an industry where success should be built on trust, we believe it’s important that our clients see not only long term financial returns, but social returns as well. That is why it’s important we develop a dialogue with each of our clients to better understand who they are and what their priorities are. Your investments can help shape the world.\n\nRather than limiting our clients’ options to fit a specific end goal in global sustainability, we at choose to look at companies as a whole. With inclusive screens we are able to align our clients’ values with the positive impacts companies may have on the world.\n\nWe are hoping to redefine the measure of success; how leaving a positive impact on the world should be considered when making decisions.

They had traveled to meet H.W.L. Poonja, the spiritual teacher fondly known as \"Papaji.\" Drawn by the search for truth and self-realization, they came to hear Papaji’s simple teachings: \"Keep Quiet. The eternal truth exists within you. Do not entertain a single thought and the truth will reveal itself to itself.\"\n\nInspired by Papaji's lifetime of service, this group had a vision to forge a path, using the global marketplace as a tool to change the face of agriculture in northern India. Their idea was simple: establish a sustainable business model to support the livelihood of thousands of marginalized farmers in India by providing training and education, enabling self-sufficiency and skills that could be passed on to future generations.\n\nThis idea became a movement as organic and biodynamic farming methods were developed and practiced. The founders’ mission to offer safe and effective herbal products to the world is the driving force behind an organic revolution that started with ORGANIC INDIA and is now taking root all across India.","market":"Developed","industry":"Food products","sector":"Wholesale/Retail","operatingCountry":"United

India. They had traveled to meet H.W.L. Poonja, the spiritual teacher fondly known as \"Papaji.\" Drawn by the search for truth and self-realization, they came to hear Papaji’s simple teachings: \"Keep Quiet. The eternal truth exists within you. Do not entertain a single thought and the truth will reveal itself to itself.\"\n\nInspired by Papaji's lifetime of service, this group had a vision to forge a path, using the global marketplace as a tool to change the face of agriculture in northern India. Their idea was simple: establish a sustainable business model to support the livelihood of thousands of marginalized farmers in India by providing training and education, enabling self-sufficiency and skills that could be passed on to future generations.\n\nThis idea became a movement as organic and biodynamic farming methods were developed and practiced. The founders’ mission to offer safe and effective herbal products to the world is the driving force behind an organic revolution that started with ORGANIC INDIA and is now taking root all across India.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"80301","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Tea, Supplements, Organic, Agriculture, Tulsi, Biodynamic, Regenerative","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"India","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1440460800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"125.8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Boulder","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"80301","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CO","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Uttar Pradesh ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Barabanki","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Boulder","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"5e7a7425-40eb-524c-b49a-5af9a498af08","name":"Treefort Music Fest","slug":"treefort-music-fest","description":"Jumping around venue to venue discovering new bands and activities keeps our short attention spans in check.

It was conceived of and grew around Kathryn’s kitchen table; as the products she made for her own pregnancy and birth became so popular that she was asked to make them for a local retailer. As demand for the products grew around the world, Motherlove grew exponentially but Kathryn never wavered from her dedication to premium quality natural and organic products, and the responsibility of being nature’s steward.\n \nToday, Motherlove products are still handmade with love in Colorado using Kathryn’s original recipes. In 2012, Motherlove took the story full circle with their acquisition of a 120-acre organic farm. There, they continue the legacy of growing organic herbs and educating families on the uses and value of medicinal plants and sustainable organic practices. Kathryn’s daughters now carry on her traditions and dedication to crafting only the finest, purest products, and using certified organic ingredients designed to nurture and soothe women on their

and baby care. It was conceived of and grew around Kathryn’s kitchen table; as the products she made for her own pregnancy and birth became so popular that she was asked to make them for a local retailer. As demand for the products grew around the world, Motherlove grew exponentially but Kathryn never wavered from her dedication to premium quality natural and organic products, and the responsibility of being nature’s steward.\n \nToday, Motherlove products are still handmade with love in Colorado using Kathryn’s original recipes. In 2012, Motherlove took the story full circle with their acquisition of a 120-acre organic farm. There, they continue the legacy of growing organic herbs and educating families on the uses and value of medicinal plants and sustainable organic practices. Kathryn’s daughters now carry on her traditions and dedication to crafting only the finest, purest products, and using certified organic ingredients designed to nurture and soothe women on their all-important journey of nurturing life.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Personal care products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"80524","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1440547200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"98.9","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Fort Collins","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"80524","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CO","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Fort Collins","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"fort collins","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"d9870495-b464-54e2-939e-397a94e9400d","name":"Forster Communications","slug":"forster-communications","description":"Forster is the UK’s leading social change communications agency, working with businesses to help protect and improve lives.

Initially, the primary function of the purchasing cooperative was to aggregate the buying power of the member companies to attain better pricing on equipment. They chose the cooperative model for its egalitarian structure, whereby members own the company, each have one vote, and share equally in the profit. This model is well established in other industries, but is very unique to the solar world.\n \nWhile the initial concept was narrow in scope, the cooperative has grown into a true community of like-minded solar energy companies, who share ideas, best practices, and business opportunities. The people involved have formed a trusted support network where they can seek advice on their business problems, and not feel so alone in navigating the challenges of the very dynamic solar industry. Amicus Solar Cooperative incorporates the interests of many stakeholders: members, suppliers, and customers and employees of the member companies when they make decisions. They believe that this is truly a better way to do business, and it is aligned with cooperative values as well.","market":"Developed","industry":"Solar panel installation","sector":"Service with

Cooperative","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"description":{"value":"Amicus Solar Cooperative was founded in 2011 with the mission to support independent solar energy businesses working to create a market solution to climate change. Initially, the primary function of the purchasing cooperative was to aggregate the buying power of the member companies to attain better pricing on equipment. They chose the cooperative model for its egalitarian structure, whereby members own the company, each have one vote, and share equally in the profit. This model is well established in other industries, but is very unique to the solar world.\n \nWhile the initial concept was narrow in scope, the cooperative has grown into a true community of like-minded solar energy companies, who share ideas, best practices, and business opportunities. The people involved have formed a trusted support network where they can seek advice on their business problems, and not feel so alone in navigating the challenges of the very dynamic solar industry. Amicus Solar Cooperative incorporates the interests of many stakeholders: members, suppliers, and customers and employees of the member companies when they make decisions. They believe that this is truly a better way to do business, and it is aligned with cooperative values as well.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Solar panel

CCC works to reduce carbon emissions, provide climate education, and achieve sustainability goals with corporations, non-profits, small businesses, and universities.\n \nCCC is also a wide disseminator of knowledge through print and media. Olivia Fussell, CCC’s managing director, is also a frequent speaker on carbon and clean energy markets.\n \n In 2015, CCC began the Carbon Neutral Checkout™, an opportunity for firms to go completely carbon-neutral at little to no cost. CCC calculates a firm’s carbon footprint associated with the numerous supply-chain stages and offers offsets to neutralize the footprint. The cost is passed on to the end customers and there are no additional costs to the company.\n \nCarbon Credit Capital’s (CCC) mission is dedicated to combating climate change and helping businesses and individuals mitigate carbon emissions. Unlike big corporations, CCC recognizes that not every individual, institution, or business has the necessary acumen or resources to make meaningful impact.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Environmental consulting","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"12567","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Carbon Neutral Checkout, Carbon Credit Capital, Carbon Offsets, Carbon Credits","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1447891200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"91.9","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Pine Plains","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"12567","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"NY","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Pine Plains","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"f2238a6a-8f55-503f-8f03-74fcd185cbc9","name":"De Krat","slug":"de-krat","description":"Every week de Krat creates a wooden crate filled with fair and seasonal products, locally grown and sustainably produced with respect for people, animals and nature.

They're savvy raconteurs, telling insightful strategic stories that reflect the unique characteristics of a brand, based on simple truths and insights. They work collaboratively with local and international brands to deliver outstanding work with tangible results. They’re honest. They have courageous conversations with their clients and they sometimes tell them things they don’t want to hear, with great outcomes. They listen and they encourage their clients to listen as they believe that brands have ears too. Like all storytellers, Mkt. Communications realises it’s in the delivery and without a compelling story, they're out of business. Over the last few years, Mkt. has grown organically, intrinsically passionate about sustainability, we’ve sought out like-minded clients, and they now represent a number of engaging brands who are redefining success in business. Mkt. Communications believes step change will happen when the business community embraces the new economy and finds innovative ways of operating in it.

On its slopes grow the grapes which make this wine. POLKURA means ÒYellow StoneÓ in the native Chilean Mapuche language, making reference to large amounts of yellow granite spread along the clay soils of the area. Decomposed granite imparts the wine minerality and elegance, whereas clay gives it body and structure. The moderate coastal climate adds spice and fruitiness, resulting in a fine, yet complex and full bodied wine with very good balance.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Emerging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Agricultural Processing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Agriculture/Growers","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"00000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"www.polkura.cl","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1450310400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"91.7","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Cardenal Caro","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Marchigue","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"00000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Cardenal Caro","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Marchigue","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"32a9526b-b847-5b88-b401-78370e074cd2","name":"Crave Fishbar","slug":"crave-fishbar","description":"Crave Fishbar (founded in 2007) is a creative, NYC neighborhood restaurant serving 100% sustainable seafood in a vibrant, convivial environment.

Before both minimalism and sustainability became trends, Eileen Fisher had the vision of a company guided by a distinctive aesthetic and an ongoing commitment to supporting women and making a positive impact in the world. In 1984, inspired by the lasting elegance and ease of the Japanese kimono, Eileen designed four simple shapes to debut at the boutique show. Three decades later, she has turned her initial $350 into $400 million (without ever engaging investors), with more than 60 stores worldwide. And most importantly, she’s pioneered a socially conscious company while becoming an icon in the fashion industry for timeless design.\n \nToday, EILEEN FISHER supports women through the collection, simplifying life and inspiring women to express their personal style, as well as through social initiatives such as the Women’s Business Grant Program, created to empower women-owned businesses, the Activating Leadership Grant, which funds programs that activate leadership qualities in women and girls and the one-of-a-kind recycle retail concept Green Eileen, which donates profits to support women, girls and environment.","market":"Developed","industry":"Apparel","sector":"Wholesale/Retail","operatingCountry":"United States","operatingProvince":"New

Before both minimalism and sustainability became trends, Eileen Fisher had the vision of a company guided by a distinctive aesthetic and an ongoing commitment to supporting women and making a positive impact in the world. In 1984, inspired by the lasting elegance and ease of the Japanese kimono, Eileen designed four simple shapes to debut at the boutique show. Three decades later, she has turned her initial $350 into $400 million (without ever engaging investors), with more than 60 stores worldwide. And most importantly, she’s pioneered a socially conscious company while becoming an icon in the fashion industry for timeless design.\n \nToday, EILEEN FISHER supports women through the collection, simplifying life and inspiring women to express their personal style, as well as through social initiatives such as the Women’s Business Grant Program, created to empower women-owned businesses, the Activating Leadership Grant, which funds programs that activate leadership qualities in women and girls and the one-of-a-kind recycle retail concept Green Eileen, which donates profits to support women, girls and environment.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United
