Still privately held, the organization is lead by Jaime Athos, CEO, who continues to champion Founder Seth TibbottÕs commitment to environmental sustainability and animal welfare.\n \n Tofurky hopes to get every bacon-chomping, barbecue-loving eater out there to see the wisdom of a plant-based diet. Vegetarian and plant-based diets have all kinds of health benefits (including significant reductions in chronic preventable conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.) Health benefits aside, plant-based lifestyles offer a profound opportunity to make a positive impact on the environment and animal welfare. Consuming one pound of plant-based protein (vs. one pound of animal protein) can save 25 pounds of green house gas emissions (about the same as driving 27 miles) and 1,500 gallons of water!

Still privately held, the organization is lead by Jaime Athos, CEO, who continues to champion Founder Seth TibbottÕs commitment to environmental sustainability and animal welfare.\n \n Tofurky hopes to get every bacon-chomping, barbecue-loving eater out there to see the wisdom of a plant-based diet. Vegetarian and plant-based diets have all kinds of health benefits (including significant reductions in chronic preventable conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.) Health benefits aside, plant-based lifestyles offer a profound opportunity to make a positive impact on the environment and animal welfare. Consuming one pound of plant-based protein (vs. one pound of animal protein) can save 25 pounds of green house gas emissions (about the same as driving 27 miles) and 1,500 gallons of water! If you ask the folks at Tofurky, the food you want to eat, the food you should eat and the food you do, should all be the same food.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"97031-2061","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Vegan, plant-based, sustainable, tofu, Tofurky, fermented","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1443139200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"81.6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Oregon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Hood River","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"97031-2061","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Oregon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"WA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Hood River","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"3f05f417-53da-5a85-bf0e-c171da1af1c7","name":"The Tea Spot PBC","slug":"the-tea-spot-pbc","description":"The Tea Spot is a for-profit philanthropic business that makes whole leaf tea effortless and accessible for everyday.

Contrast that with the lifetime warranty on all residential furniture from The Joinery, an Oregon manufacturer of handcrafted hardwood furniture since 1982. In its 20,000 square foot Portland woodshop and showroom, The JoineryÕs talented artisans create pieces that are as beautiful as they are durable, using classic joinery construction techniques, sustainably harvested wood, and natural oil finishes. Each piece of furniture is signed by its builder. This level of ownership is a source of pride and signals a deep commitment to each and every piece.\n \n For The JoineryÕs skilled designers and master craftsmen, there is a clear relationship between form, function, material choice and sustainable practices. The overwhelming majority of lumber used in its products is locally sourced, certified by the Forestry Stewardship Council, or both.\n \n No wood scraps or sawdust are ever sent to the landfill. All scrap wood is recycled into new products or donated to area woodworking programs. One symbol of this commitment is the companyÕs annual Metamortise Award, which honors the employee who designs and builds the most innovative piece of furniture from leftover lumber.","market":"Developed","industry":"Furniture","sector":"Manufacturing","operatingCountry":"United

Contrast that with the lifetime warranty on all residential furniture from The Joinery, an Oregon manufacturer of handcrafted hardwood furniture since 1982. In its 20,000 square foot Portland woodshop and showroom, The JoineryÕs talented artisans create pieces that are as beautiful as they are durable, using classic joinery construction techniques, sustainably harvested wood, and natural oil finishes. Each piece of furniture is signed by its builder. This level of ownership is a source of pride and signals a deep commitment to each and every piece.\n \n For The JoineryÕs skilled designers and master craftsmen, there is a clear relationship between form, function, material choice and sustainable practices. The overwhelming majority of lumber used in its products is locally sourced, certified by the Forestry Stewardship Council, or both.\n \n No wood scraps or sawdust are ever sent to the landfill. All scrap wood is recycled into new products or donated to area woodworking programs. One symbol of this commitment is the companyÕs annual Metamortise Award, which honors the employee who designs and builds the most innovative piece of furniture from leftover lumber.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Furniture","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"97203","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"the joinery, joinery, furniture, sustainable construction, interior design, thejoinery, wood, woodworker, carpenter, carpentry handcrafted furniture solid wood furniture modern furniture wood furniture craftsmanship fsc mission furniture wood furniture f","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1283299200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"84.8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Oregon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Portland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"97203","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"OR","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Oregon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Portland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"e487bf61-8734-56a3-8db9-c0d864fe143c","name":"The Image Shoppe","slug":"the-image-shoppe","description":"The Image Shoppe is committed to becoming a brand marketing ally for more organizations, expanding our geographic reach and seeking allies who value and respect their work.

\n\nTGW Studio leads the region in integrating branding with mission-driven strategies while also creating shared value and instilling cultural change for their partners. TGW Studio has deep B2C and B2B client partnerships including global consumer brands (CPG / food & beverage), national mission-driven companies, technology, renewable energy, healthcare, education, and nonprofits. \n\nThe future will rely on businesses of all shapes and sizes to be a force for good. TGW works with organizations ready to put a dent in (or fully demolish) their “business as usual” status and those ready to turn the impact dial up to 10. They’re a team of nice people doing things to make a difference. They’re at their best when working with similarly nice people with similarly impactful ideas. They don’t make things to enter into award shows or to bring them individual praise. TGW Studio discovers problems that they think they can have a part in fixing and holes they think they can have a part in filling. They create things they think can have a positive impact on this planet and the people on it.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Advertising & market research","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"14604","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"marketing, branding, web development, product development, ecommerce, e-commerce, advertising, social good, social responsibility, CSR, corporate social responsibility, business services, advertising, content development, media, business strategy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1453852800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"84.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Rochester","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"14604","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"NY","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Rochester","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"f03b928f-fe31-5768-8906-178d5f701a43","name":"Tessi Consulting","slug":"tessi-consulting","description":"Tessi Consulting is a Boston based diversity firm focused on helping midsize US & global corporations on a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) journey.

Spring Bank has been designated by the US Treasury as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), in recognition of the investments and loans the bank makes in low and moderate income communities in New York City. Spring Bank is also a preferred lender with the US Small Business Administration (SBA).\n \n Spring Bank's mission is to pursue a double bottom line of providing returns to its shareholders and serving the needs of underserved consumers and small businesses in the New York City area. In neighborhoods where the use of high-cost fringe financial products is more the norm than the exception, the bank has created innovative depository and loan products designed to help unbanked and underbanked consumers avoid getting trapped in cycles of debt and build wealth. In addition the bank attempts to serve the needs of the small businesses that create wealth and jobs for residents of the New York City area.","market":"Developed","industry":"Deposit bank - Developed

Spring Bank has been designated by the US Treasury as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), in recognition of the investments and loans the bank makes in low and moderate income communities in New York City. Spring Bank is also a preferred lender with the US Small Business Administration (SBA).\n \n Spring Bank's mission is to pursue a double bottom line of providing returns to its shareholders and serving the needs of underserved consumers and small businesses in the New York City area. In neighborhoods where the use of high-cost fringe financial products is more the norm than the exception, the bank has created innovative depository and loan products designed to help unbanked and underbanked consumers avoid getting trapped in cycles of debt and build wealth. In addition the bank attempts to serve the needs of the small businesses that create wealth and jobs for residents of the New York City area.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Deposit bank - Developed Markets","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"10452","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Bronx Bank, Bronx Community Bank, Harlem Bank, Harlem Community Bank, New York City Community Bank, NYC Community Bank, Community Bank New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1460592000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"136.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Bronx","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"10452","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"DE","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Bronx","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"aec2f546-7848-5334-a599-df2fb86fe592","name":"Spottswoode","slug":"spottswoode","description":"Established in 1882, Spottswoode is a family-owned historic vineyard and winery in the Napa Valley renowned for its elegant, balanced Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc.

Now, they are able to devote a portion of their garden to growing peppers as a cash crop, which allows them to fund their vital social programming.\n\nSmall Axe Peppers allows you to directly support these urban farms and community gardens in your neighborhood each time you purchase this delicious hot sauce.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food
