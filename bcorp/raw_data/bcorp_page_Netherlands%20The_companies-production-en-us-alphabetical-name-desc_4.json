A small team but with big ambition and a big heart, it’s not the size of project that matters to Cause4 but whether it can make an impact. Provoking change is at the heart of our mission. \n \nCause4 works in partnership with corporations, charities and people to develop important charitable projects, create new business models, as well as to raise vital funds. Learning lessons from the private sector to benefit not-for-profit organisations, since set up in May 2009, Cause4 has raised over £46 million for clients, and is committed to helping attract the best graduate talent to work on some of the world’s most pressing issues.\n \nCause4 wants charities and social enterprises to become more business-minded; and businesses and corporate leaders to become more socially-minded. They believe that if these two sectors can meet in the middle, then everyone will see the greatest possible innovation in addressing issues of social need and challenge, allowing for huge impact in addressing some of the most intractable social problems in the world today, at a global and local level.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Management consultant - nonprofits","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"IP24 1JD","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Charity, philanthropy, fundraising, strategy, non-profit, not-for-profit, management consulting","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1454889600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"116.9","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Norfolk","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Thetford","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"IP24 1JD","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Norfolk","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"not listed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Thetford","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"ca6e4a91-0421-577c-b935-386204ab0b2c","name":"Cap Equity Advisors","slug":"cap-equity-advisors","description":"CapEQ is Europe’s first B-Corp mergers & acquisitions advisor, specialising in helping business owners buy and sell companies and seek external investment.\nEstablished in London in 2020, CapEQ is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, and secured B-Corp accreditation by pioneering a digitally native transaction process to reduce unnecessary printing and speed up negotiations.

It was love at first taste. Menno vowed then and there to introduce it back home – help the farmers he’d befriended to get an organic certification– and make them benefit from their hard work. Back home in Amsterdam, Menno hid away in his garage with a small PROBAT Roaster and experimented with the different ways of roasting his haul of Ethiopian coffee beans. Before long, he was selling small batches of coffee to delighted friends and neighbours. And taking repeat orders. Bocca was born. And thus began a lifelong pursuit of perfection.\n\nBocca is proud to have a diverse portfolio of businesses in the Netherlands and beyond: espresso bars, restaurants, hotels and offices.

A Climate Positive calvados, removing 2.73kg/CO2e per bottle, while saving the bees (a proportion of revenue from every bottle sold is donated to charities that support the protection of bees). Avallen is made with no added sugar and minimal processing, so this spirit tastes as good as it is to the planet!\n\nWhat is Avallen? It is a natural, fruity and floral calvados made with over 40 different varieties of apples. It’s produced in the West of Normandy, and aged for a minimum of two years in French Oak before being bottled with no added sugar or nasties! A seriously fresh take in the world of calvados.\n\nFloral aromas of fresh apples and honeysuckle on the nose, lead to a palate filled with flavours of toffee apple.
