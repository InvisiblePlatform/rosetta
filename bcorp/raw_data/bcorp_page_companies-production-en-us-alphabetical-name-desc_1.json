Their focus is primarily in affordable housing, small business, mixed use development, community facilities, solar energy financing, and commercial real estate.\n\nVCC was established in 2006 as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) with an initial $15 million investment under Governor Mark R. Warner. The goal was to leverage that initial investment for an economic return to underserved areas. More than $2.4 million was originated across our first seven real estate development loans.\n\nSince then? Growth, expansion and partnership.\n\nThrough the power of partnerships and leverage, they have turned that $15 million seed investment into over $1.2 billion of impact in Virginia. Over the years, VCC has become known for its ability to combine the resources of national, state, and local social investors into successfully funded projects. They are, many times, the “first in” on projects designed to positively impact their community.\n\nAnd they’re just getting started.

to support community development ventures, create jobs, and build sustainable communities by providing flexible financing and advisory services in underserved markets and for low- to moderate-income people. Their focus is primarily in affordable housing, small business, mixed use development, community facilities, solar energy financing, and commercial real estate.\n\nVCC was established in 2006 as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) with an initial $15 million investment under Governor Mark R. Warner. The goal was to leverage that initial investment for an economic return to underserved areas. More than $2.4 million was originated across our first seven real estate development loans.\n\nSince then? Growth, expansion and partnership.\n\nThrough the power of partnerships and leverage, they have turned that $15 million seed investment into over $1.2 billion of impact in Virginia. Over the years, VCC has become known for its ability to combine the resources of national, state, and local social investors into successfully funded projects. They are, many times, the “first in” on projects designed to positively impact their community.\n\nAnd they’re just getting started.

Meanwhile in Vermont, two young visionaries, Allison Hooper and Bob Reese were building a business that would, against all odds, introduce American diners to handcrafted goat cheese and later European-style cultured butter – Vermont Creamery. \n\nCrafted in Vermont’s green mountains, Vermont Creamery’s line of fresh and aged goat cheeses, cultured butter, and crème fraîche have won hundreds of national and international awards. In their 35th year of business, Vermont Creamery supports a network of more than 17 family farms, promoting sustainable agriculture in the region. B Corp Certified in 2014, Vermont Creamery has been ranked one of “The Best Places to Work in Vermont,” by Vermont Business Magazine. Vermont Creamery is a subsidiary of Minnesota-based Land O’Lakes, Inc., one of America’s premier agribusiness and food companies.

is proud to be classified as the first of a new class-of-trade: Medical Benefit Manager (MBM). As an MBM, Ventegra’s Pharmacy Services Administration (PSA) program offers innovative solutions for cost-efficient pharmaceutical services that maximize benefits for payors, providers and patients. Their ideas push the boundaries of current practices in managing healthcare costs. They understand the unique needs and concerns of employers, managed care organizations (MCOs), providers (both pharmacy and medical), trade organizations and pharmaceutical industry that enables them to improve the way drug benefits are designed, delivered and managed. For example, unlike PBM’s, the Ventegra acquisition cost-based PSA solution provides payors with the assurance that what is billed to them is what was paid to the pharmacy. Unlike PBM’s, their proprietary Robo-Rebate process ensures 100% of available discounts (including rebates) are available to clients on a monthly basis and not siphoned off for other purposes. Their dedicated team of professionals helps our clients improve efficiencies, lower costs, and improve the overall quality of care.","market":"Developed","industry":"Other human

As an MBM, Ventegra’s Pharmacy Services Administration (PSA) program offers innovative solutions for cost-efficient pharmaceutical services that maximize benefits for payors, providers and patients. Their ideas push the boundaries of current practices in managing healthcare costs. They understand the unique needs and concerns of employers, managed care organizations (MCOs), providers (both pharmacy and medical), trade organizations and pharmaceutical industry that enables them to improve the way drug benefits are designed, delivered and managed. For example, unlike PBM’s, the Ventegra acquisition cost-based PSA solution provides payors with the assurance that what is billed to them is what was paid to the pharmacy. Unlike PBM’s, their proprietary Robo-Rebate process ensures 100% of available discounts (including rebates) are available to clients on a monthly basis and not siphoned off for other purposes. Their dedicated team of professionals helps our clients improve efficiencies, lower costs, and improve the overall quality of care.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other human health","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"91203","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"pharmacy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1417737600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"81.7","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Glendale","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"91203","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Glendale","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"0c8b5244-4ebc-5bba-987d-65585cabca7d","name":"Vendredi","slug":"work-for-good","description":"Vendredi, c'est le partenaire de référence de la transformation sociale et environnementale des entreprises.\nAvec sa plateforme d'engagement citoyen, Vendredi permet à chaque entreprise de sensibiliser ses salariés sur tous les grands enjeux de notre époque ; de les aider à avoir un impact positif dans leur travail ; et de les accompagner dans l'accélération de leurs démarches d'impact !

every woman experiences fit problems with her jeans - loose waistbands, saggy stretch denim - but almost none of us regularly wear a belt. Why? Bulk under t-shirts from big buckles; \"muffin-top\" from pinching leather; and the hassle of threading a belt into and out of belt loops.\n \nTheir team designed Unbelt because we needed a better solution. Their belts are super comfy, completely bulkless, and machine-washable right in the belt loops. Adjustable to fit sizes 0 through 24X, they close the gap at the back of our customers' jeans - in other words, creating a perfect fit without the need for pricey tailoring.\n \nThey distribute through a network of over 300 Canadian retailers, and through our website to customers from Iceland to Estonia. They speak loudly about the need for supply chain transparency in the fashion industry, and for the rights of garment workers to equitable working conditions. It's a \"who, not where\" approach to ethical fashion, because they believe that quality jobs are possible - and necessary - everywhere in the world that clothing is made.\n \nThey're small, but growing. They value resilience, bootstrapping, and community-growing. Their clients are like gold to them, and they work hard to make sure they know how highly they're valued.","market":"Developed -

- loose waistbands, saggy stretch denim - but almost none of us regularly wear a belt. Why? Bulk under t-shirts from big buckles; \"muffin-top\" from pinching leather; and the hassle of threading a belt into and out of belt loops.\n \nTheir team designed Unbelt because we needed a better solution. Their belts are super comfy, completely bulkless, and machine-washable right in the belt loops. Adjustable to fit sizes 0 through 24X, they close the gap at the back of our customers' jeans - in other words, creating a perfect fit without the need for pricey tailoring.\n \nThey distribute through a network of over 300 Canadian retailers, and through our website to customers from Iceland to Estonia. They speak loudly about the need for supply chain transparency in the fashion industry, and for the rights of garment workers to equitable working conditions. It's a \"who, not where\" approach to ethical fashion, because they believe that quality jobs are possible - and necessary - everywhere in the world that clothing is made.\n \nThey're small, but growing. They value resilience, bootstrapping, and community-growing. Their clients are like gold to them, and they work hard to make sure they know how highly they're valued.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"T6E 0Z2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"fashion, accessories, Canada, China, ethical manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"China","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1445904000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"89.6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Alberta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Edmonton","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"T6E 0Z2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"AB","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Alberta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Kansas","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Edmonton","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Lawrence","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"0c32811b-6032-54b3-a1d8-873c54fd8344","name":"UMUNTU","slug":"umuntu","description":"Consultora en accesibilidad e inclusión de personas en situación de discapacidad.

The mixed waste stream, including the organics fractions like food waste, garden trimmings, paper, cardboard, diapers, dirty plastics, as well as packaging materials are converted from seemingly heterogeneous waste streams into an entirely homogeneous material that can be used in existing plastic processing equipment. During the conversion process, the unsorted residual waste stream is reduced into many of its more basic natural components.
