From its Cingoli headquarters, in the province of Macerata, it has been running business since 1978. Backed by its Fileni, Fileni Bio, Sempre Domenica and Club dei Galli signature brands and a widespread structure in the large-scale retail, normal trade and Ho.re.ca distribution channels, Fileni is one of the biggest Italian player in this industry. In addition to Italy, Fileni sells in over 30 countries abroad, 90% of which in Europe. Fileni's supply chain starts from the fields where raw materials for feeding animals are grown, goes all the way through hundreds of traditional and organic breeding farms mainly located in Central Italy and ends up on the dishes of Italian families. Innovation, quality, animal welfare and environmental sustainability are Fileni’s trademarks: since 1989 it has been making ready-to-eat products in a dedicated plant, in 2001 the organic production was launched and it has been providing its stakeholders with a proper sustainability report as of 2018.
