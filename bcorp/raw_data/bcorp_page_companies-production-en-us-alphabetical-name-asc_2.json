With more than 2 million users around the world, Benevity will process donations benefitting more than 100,000 global charities this year. As a certified B Corporation, Benevity joins a new breed of for-profit companies with a social mission who are setting the standard for doing well by doing good.\n\nBenevity hopes to use their technology through multiple integrations to make giving to the charity of one’s choice as convenient and prevalent as leaving a tip at a restaurant. Benevity envisions a reshaping of the notion and execution of personal and corporate philanthropy that sees it embedded into a variety of everyday consumptive and commercial activities. In such a landscape, people from all demographics – regardless of their means – can give money, time, goods, etc. to the social causes of their choice, while corporations better utilize their resources and influence to do the same in a virtuous circle.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Computer programming services","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental

They use Spark to attract, retain and engage today’s workers by connecting people personally to causes that matter to them. With more than 2 million users around the world, Benevity will process donations benefitting more than 100,000 global charities this year. As a certified B Corporation, Benevity joins a new breed of for-profit companies with a social mission who are setting the standard for doing well by doing good.\n\nBenevity hopes to use their technology through multiple integrations to make giving to the charity of one’s choice as convenient and prevalent as leaving a tip at a restaurant. Benevity envisions a reshaping of the notion and execution of personal and corporate philanthropy that sees it embedded into a variety of everyday consumptive and commercial activities. In such a landscape, people from all demographics – regardless of their means – can give money, time, goods, etc. to the social causes of their choice, while corporations better utilize their resources and influence to do the same in a virtuous circle.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Computer programming services","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"T2E 2W5","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"workplace giving, philanthropy, matching, employee giving, employee volunteering, tracking, volunteers, grants, non profits, software","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"India","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ireland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Italy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Spain","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1306800000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"112.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Alberta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Calgary","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"T2E 2W5","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Alberta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Calgary","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"743f9732-5b53-5389-9533-cbb3802dfb29","name":"Benjie of  Switzerland","slug":"benjie-of-switzerland","description":"A small step towards a big improvement!\n\nBenjie of Switzerland is a beautiful adventure driven by the idea of combining the notion of entrepreneurial success with the common good.

We will not take on a project or enact a company policy that does not align with those values. \n\n\nWe are proud to be a certified B Corporation and a member of this growing community of businesses focused on environmental and social responsibility.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Environmental consulting","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"21211","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Ecological Restoration, Conservation Planning, Regenerative Design, Design, Design-Build, Water, Biodiversity, Sustainability, Ecology, Green Infrastructure","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1517356800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"110.9","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Maryland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Baltimore","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"21211","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"MD","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Maryland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New Mexico","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ohio","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Oregon","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"South Carolina","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Baltimore","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Cleveland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Denver","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Mt.

First sold as greeting cards in specialty retail markets, Bloomin paper has grown into a extensive line of promotional products, retail stationary gifts, direct marketing solutions, and wedding invitations.\n \nBased in Boulder, Colorado, an eco-minded community, Bloomin embraced this attitude from the start. They continue to add alternative energy and eco-technologies as they grow, and they have always manufactured the most Earth-friendly printed marketing medium available. Their seed paper is crafted from 100% post-industrial, recycled paper and dyed with all-natural, vegetable-based pigments. Their products are printed with water-based inks and, when included, use corn-based packaging. Their production facility is now powered by a 30kW solar power system—enough for all of our energy needs and then some.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Paper & paper products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"80301","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"earth friendly, sustainable, handmade, green, plantable seed paper, cards that grow, seed embedded paper. wildflower seed paper, herb seed paper. eco friendly, Earth day, sustainable promotions, bloomin, bcorp","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1453766400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"91.8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Boulder","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"80301","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CO","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Boulder","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"d0b34f72-c101-53fe-aa6c-d646133bf09d","name":"Blue Apple Beach House","slug":"blue-apple-beach-house","description":"Hidden away on the southern shore of the island of Tierra Bomba, just off the coast of Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Blue Apple Beach is an independently owned boutique hotel and beach club with a strong focus on fun and also on sustainable tourism.

Just by working to certify Boomerang as a B-Corp, their entire staff became even more aware of ways they can effect change in the communities around them.\n \n With that in mind, they expect to continue to expand on what they currently do and what they will learn to do in the future. This will be accomplished by engaging with other B-Corp members that share their goals. Also, with some of the changes they made to volunteering and pro-bono work, they will continue to educate themselves as they move through their community and environmental goals. \n \n It is through this hope that they will not only educate their clients and peers but also help develop their own understanding of their place in their community and the world around them.","market":"Developed","industry":"Other info service activities","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","operatingCountry":"United

They work with legal service firms who serve the due diligence needs of corporations, law firms and lenders involved in mergers and acquisitions, commercial and residential real estate transactions, and lending activities within Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin counties.\n \n In Boomerang's daily work, they rarely get the opportunity to feel like they can make a difference in their community. Just by working to certify Boomerang as a B-Corp, their entire staff became even more aware of ways they can effect change in the communities around them.\n \n With that in mind, they expect to continue to expand on what they currently do and what they will learn to do in the future. This will be accomplished by engaging with other B-Corp members that share their goals. Also, with some of the changes they made to volunteering and pro-bono work, they will continue to educate themselves as they move through their community and environmental goals. \n \n It is through this hope that they will not only educate their clients and peers but also help develop their own understanding of their place in their community and the world around them.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other info service

Packaging that already has a value is recycled at a much greater extent than packaging that does. The PET bottle is an excellent example. By making monetary values and discount coupons available to those who scan and recycle with the app, the effect will be the same, but for all packaging with a barcode and not just for the pet bottle. We can use the existing infrastructure and increase recycling by adding motivating elements in the form of incentives. With the Bower app, you can scan almost everything with a barcode.

Packaging that already has a value is recycled at a much greater extent than packaging that does. The PET bottle is an excellent example. By making monetary values and discount coupons available to those who scan and recycle with the app, the effect will be the same, but for all packaging with a barcode and not just for the pet bottle. We can use the existing infrastructure and increase recycling by adding motivating elements in the form of incentives. With the Bower app, you can scan almost everything with a barcode.
