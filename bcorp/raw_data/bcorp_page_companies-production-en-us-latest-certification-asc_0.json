By June, 2006 Lara joined the Board of Directors of 1% and by February, 2008 The Law Office of Lara Pearson became one of the world’s first Certified B Corporations. Yay!\n \nLara’s deep involvement in the social enterprise community enables her to see things other attorneys miss, providing immeasurable value to her clients. For example, Lara once identified infringement on one of her client’s marks and got the infringer to switch brands (cease and desist) before her client even knew of the infringement.\n \nLara is exceptionally skilled at making intellectual property (IP) law easy and fun. She has a real knack for conveying her knowledge in an engaging and entertaining way that makes complex subject matter not only simple and understandable, but also enjoyable.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Legal activities","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"89451","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"law firm, brand protection, intellectual property, IP, trademarks, law, CSR, corporate social responsibility, lara pearson, legal, trademark law, trademark rights, IP protection, intangible property, IP assets, Nevada, soulfulpreneurship, cannabis law","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1202947200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"95.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Nevada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Incline Village","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"89451","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"NV","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Nevada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Incline Village","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"07bc5a98-ce5b-57cd-aabb-70fec5c551f8","name":"Idealist Consulting","slug":"idealist-consulting","description":"Idealist Consulting helps nonprofits and progressive businesses grow through technology.

With the goal of reviving herbalism in North America, they traveled to the source of medicinal plants—often in remote, rural areas. On their travels, they were shocked to discover the poor social, living and working conditions of the mostly indigenous and impoverished herb farmers and wild collectors.\n\nFollowing the principles of right livelihood, the company pioneered a new ethical sourcing model by promoting organic agriculture, developing long-term equitable and fair trading relationships, and investing in these sourcing communities.\n\nOver four decades later, their teas are still formulated by herbalists, sourced responsibly and tested for quality by plant scientists. Their purposeful mission continues through your conscious choice to support Traditional Medicinals. Hoping to empower consumers to take responsibility for their own health, Traditional Medicinals believes in creating the highest quality products by considering every step of the process from their farms to your pantry, from sustainability and responsible sourcing, to social business practices. Plant Power for a Better You® isn’t just a tagline—it’s our mission.","market":"Developed","industry":"Beverages","sector":"Manufacturing","operatingCountry":"United

medicinal herbal tea company. With the goal of reviving herbalism in North America, they traveled to the source of medicinal plants—often in remote, rural areas. On their travels, they were shocked to discover the poor social, living and working conditions of the mostly indigenous and impoverished herb farmers and wild collectors.\n\nFollowing the principles of right livelihood, the company pioneered a new ethical sourcing model by promoting organic agriculture, developing long-term equitable and fair trading relationships, and investing in these sourcing communities.\n\nOver four decades later, their teas are still formulated by herbalists, sourced responsibly and tested for quality by plant scientists. Their purposeful mission continues through your conscious choice to support Traditional Medicinals. Hoping to empower consumers to take responsibility for their own health, Traditional Medicinals believes in creating the highest quality products by considering every step of the process from their farms to your pantry, from sustainability and responsible sourcing, to social business practices.

Its leadership team, including co-founders Janine Benyus and Dr. Dayna Baumeister, have worked in concert with staff and partners worldwide to reach millions through talks, walks, and media as well as trained hundreds who now practice biomimicry in their professions.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other professional, scientific & tech","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"59801-2723","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Biomimicry innovation consulting training education development connect redesign design workshops institute resources tools schools montana 3.8 strategy curricula efficient online courses imitation nature professional training sustainability","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1294704000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"80.6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Montana","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Missoula","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"59801-2723","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"DE","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Montana","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Missoula","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"f24770e2-e2e3-5001-b70e-5c2b4b3d09f8","name":"Sustainability Advantage","slug":"sustainability-advantage","description":"The Sustainability Advantage is the company behind leading author Bob Willard that has a two-fold mission:\n \n 1.

The company’s innovative approach began with serving freshly prepared, healthy meals to students in schools nationwide, and the company has now designed, produced and delivered over 360 million kid-inspired, chef-crafted meals to sites across 15 states, including childhood education centers, districts, charter schools, and community and afterschool youth programs. \n\nRevolution Foods’ experience shows—and studies support—that nutritious foods drive improved health and academic outcomes. A recent impact assessment conducted by KKS Advisors on behalf of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation found schools that serve Revolution Foods saw an improvement of 13.1% in English Language Arts (ELA) test results. \n\nTogether with best-in-class community partners such as FoodCorps, Stephen and Ayesha Curry’s Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation and Wellness in the Schools (WITS), as well as local partners, Revolution Foods equips parents, teachers and students with valuable tools and resources to continue positive nutrition

problem of limited access to healthy meals for every child in America. The company’s innovative approach began with serving freshly prepared, healthy meals to students in schools nationwide, and the company has now designed, produced and delivered over 360 million kid-inspired, chef-crafted meals to sites across 15 states, including childhood education centers, districts, charter schools, and community and afterschool youth programs. \n\nRevolution Foods’ experience shows—and studies support—that nutritious foods drive improved health and academic outcomes. A recent impact assessment conducted by KKS Advisors on behalf of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation found schools that serve Revolution Foods saw an improvement of 13.1% in English Language Arts (ELA) test results. \n\nTogether with best-in-class community partners such as FoodCorps, Stephen and Ayesha Curry’s Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation and Wellness in the Schools (WITS), as well as local partners, Revolution Foods equips parents, teachers and students with valuable tools and resources to continue positive nutrition education beyond the lunch line.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"94607","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"revolution foods, school lunch, healthy school lunch, school nutrition, school meal, afterschool meal, school meal program, breakfast in classroom, community meal program, nutrition and academic performance, food and school performance","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1301011200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"82.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Oakland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"94607","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"DE","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Louisiana","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Maryland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Massachusetts","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New Jersey","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Texas","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Boston","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Cheverly","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Commerce City","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Edison","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Kenner","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"La Mirada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Oakland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"San Lorenzo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Stafford","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"43a47bad-afd8-593d-9b23-e2c00a6ebf17","name":"Core Capital Management","slug":"core-capital-management","description":"Core Capital Management (CCM) is an innovative, independent wealth management firm focused on sustainable responsible investment (\"SRI\") management, planning and practices.

The company helps clients avoid profiting from the exploitation of people and the environment, while working with clients and their capital to press for a healthier, more sustainable society.\n \nA pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing (SRI), Clean Yield began in 1985 as a stock-market newsletter that provided buy and sell advice on socially and financially screened securities. Subscribers could avoid tobacco, alcohol, gambling, pornography, weapons, nuclear power, defense contractors, and a number of other areas of concern. Instead, they could direct their investments toward companies with products and services making positive social contributions. Within two years, the principals formed Clean Yield Asset Management, which serves SRI clients by buying and selling securities on their behalf. Clean Yield’s services also include community investing, slow-money investing, and “shareholder activism”—i.e., using the ownership of a company’s shares for leverage in advancing corporate responsibility.","market":"Developed","industry":"Investment advising","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","operatingCountry":"United

social impact. The company helps clients avoid profiting from the exploitation of people and the environment, while working with clients and their capital to press for a healthier, more sustainable society.\n \nA pioneer in the field of socially responsible investing (SRI), Clean Yield began in 1985 as a stock-market newsletter that provided buy and sell advice on socially and financially screened securities. Subscribers could avoid tobacco, alcohol, gambling, pornography, weapons, nuclear power, defense contractors, and a number of other areas of concern. Instead, they could direct their investments toward companies with products and services making positive social contributions. Within two years, the principals formed Clean Yield Asset Management, which serves SRI clients by buying and selling securities on their behalf. Clean Yield’s services also include community investing, slow-money investing, and “shareholder activism”—i.e., using the ownership of a company’s shares for leverage in advancing corporate responsibility.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Investment advising","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"05055","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"clean yield group, social investing SRI Sustainability Socially Responsible Investing Shareholder activism Slow Money Advocacy Community Investing Local Stocks Green investment management directed divestment financial transaction impact vt vermont","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1303257600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"157.8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Vermont","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Norwich","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"05055","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"VT","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Vermont","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Norwich","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"0446603d-c216-5117-8b92-22a66fe76e37","name":"Participate Learning","slug":"participate","description":"Participate Learning is a force for good that connects teachers and students through comprehensive programs to foster human understanding and create peace around the world.

Wherever and whenever you need it, Warby Parker is there to make exceptional vision care simple and accessible. (Delightful, too.) \n\nUltimately, Warby Parker believes in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses they sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through Warby Parker’s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program.

constantly asking how they can do more and make a greater impact—and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. The lifestyle brand aims to demonstrate that a business can scale, be profitable, and do good in the world— without charging a premium for it. \n\nSince the day the company launched in 2010, Warby Parker has pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. They offer everything you need for happier eyes at a price that leaves you with money in your pocket, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests, and you can meet them online, at their stores, or even in your home. Wherever and whenever you need it, Warby Parker is there to make exceptional vision care simple and accessible. (Delightful, too.) \n\nUltimately, Warby Parker believes in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses they sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through Warby Parker’s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program. As of 2020, over eight million pairs have been distributed.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other

As a certified B Corporation, Benevity joins a new breed of for-profit companies with a social mission who are setting the standard for doing well by doing good.\n\nBenevity hopes to use their technology through multiple integrations to make giving to the charity of one’s choice as convenient and prevalent as leaving a tip at a restaurant. Benevity envisions a reshaping of the notion and execution of personal and corporate philanthropy that sees it embedded into a variety of everyday consumptive and commercial activities. In such a landscape, people from all demographics – regardless of their means – can give money, time, goods, etc. to the social causes of their choice, while corporations better utilize their resources and influence to do the same in a virtuous circle.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Computer programming services","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"T2E 2W5","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"workplace giving, philanthropy, matching, employee giving, employee volunteering, tracking, volunteers, grants, non profits, software","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"India","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ireland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Italy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Spain","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1306800000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"112.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Alberta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Calgary","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"T2E 2W5","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Alberta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Calgary","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"dbf269f9-57a3-5ee1-a678-9cfe8639af12","name":"Ingage Partners","slug":"ingage-partners-llc","description":"Ingage supports technology innovators by designing, building, and delivering quality software solutions.

Becoming a B Corp certifies that that both the economic and social values of our model are part of our mission and rates our effectiveness in accomplishing them.\n\nThe Change We Seek\t\n\nIn spite of unprecedented economic and demographic growth over the past several years, many developing nations are confronted with the perpetual problem of housing. Today there is a total housing deficit of over 400 million around the world. In order to cope with a flawed housing delivery system, most families construct their own homes magnifying the problem since materials are inherently expensive and financing for this segment of the market is limited. Thus, housing fails to fulfill its basic economic function of building household wealth and falls short in its social function.\n\nEchale Tu Casa seeks to revert this vicious cycle by correcting the flaws inherent to the self-build process, thus allowing it to deliver returns on economic, social, and environmental levels. Through Echale’s innovative model, families can build their own home becoming proprietors of a patrimony that they can count on and inherit to the next generation.

Becoming a B Corp certifies that that both the economic and social values of our model are part of our mission and rates our effectiveness in accomplishing them.\n\nThe Change We Seek\t\n\nIn spite of unprecedented economic and demographic growth over the past several years, many developing nations are confronted with the perpetual problem of housing. Today there is a total housing deficit of over 400 million around the world. In order to cope with a flawed housing delivery system, most families construct their own homes magnifying the problem since materials are inherently expensive and financing for this segment of the market is limited. Thus, housing fails to fulfill its basic economic function of building household wealth and falls short in its social function.\n\nEchale Tu Casa seeks to revert this vicious cycle by correcting the flaws inherent to the self-build process, thus allowing it to deliver returns on economic, social, and environmental levels. Through Echale’s innovative model, families can build their own home becoming proprietors of a patrimony that they can count on and inherit to the next generation.

By improving home care jobs, CHCA transforms challenges faced by unemployed women into sustainable opportunities for economic independence – and improves care for thousands of low-income city residents.\n \nIn the lasting recession, the Bronx continues to see unemployment rates near 14 percent, with the core neighborhoods that the agency serves seeing unemployment significantly higher. With its affiliate PHI, CHCA responds to these challenges by providing free training and guaranteed, high-quality employment for hundreds of women each year.\n \nRecognizing that many participants face significant, compound barriers to employment, CHCA’s workforce development program provides comprehensive home health training with guaranteed jobs for graduates, targeted mentoring, and a range

Eventually, Feronia will generate revenues from conservation easements and carbon sequestration, since our forests are located in highly environmentally-sensitive areas.\n \nRamblewild is Feronia’s main vehicle to monetize the recreational potential of our forests: visitors meander from tree to tree at various heights through a pristine hemlock forest. The trails are designed to have a profound impact on visitors’ self-confidence and happiness. Aerial parks are a new outdoor activity in and amongst the trees that offer excitement, challenge, and personal growth for adventurists and for the entire family.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Growing perennial

Or from the first sip of the ginger and cardamom infused bottled ready to drink, you can taste the fresh micro-brewed difference.\n \nBut Bhakti is far more than an assortment of spicy drinks. Bhakti, or devotion through social action, is their company philosophy. Social change is a mandate that steeps into all of their business practices.
