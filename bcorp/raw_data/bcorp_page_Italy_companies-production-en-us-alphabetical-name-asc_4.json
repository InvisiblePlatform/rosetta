TOMbag created the world’s first fully circular solution for waste disposal: their reusable garbage bags are made out of post-consumer waste using GRS certified recycled plastic and can be fully upcycled at the end of their life. TOMbag reusable garbage bags are designed to last, are easily washable and 100% waterproof. They can be used for all kinds of waste and occasions (general waste, recyclables and even compost - at home and at such occasions as camping). TOMbag also works with businesses providing them with different sizes of reusable garbage bags including custom-made solutions. TOMbag is committed to donate at least 3% of its revenues to charitable partners with an environmental focus. As a part of this commitment TOMbag plants a tree in Australia for each sale made via a partnership with One Tree Planted.
