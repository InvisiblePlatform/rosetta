all products be truly natural, they follow the Mãe Terra 7 principles: foods that are trully whole, less processed; organic whenever possible; with ingredients that value the Brazilian biodiversity; favoring local and family farmers; free of chemical additives and GMOs and, of course, very tasty.\n \n Mãe Terra faces the challenge of growing, though within the limits of nature, valuing the environmental preservation and social care.\n \n They enjoy the privilege of being born in a country of rich biodiversity, Brazil, which in turn, allows them to experience and value ingredients that were historically underutilized by the food industry. The appreciation of the Brazilian biodiversity opens many opportunities, but also puts more responsibility on our shoulders, for they have to consider the use of sustainable resources.\n \n Offering

a healthier and more balanced life.\n \n To ensure that they stay on track and that all products be truly natural, they follow the Mãe Terra 7 principles: foods that are trully whole, less processed; organic whenever possible; with ingredients that value the Brazilian biodiversity; favoring local and family farmers; free of chemical additives and GMOs and, of course, very tasty.\n \n Mãe Terra faces the challenge of growing, though within the limits of nature, valuing the environmental preservation and social care.\n \n They enjoy the privilege of being born in a country of rich biodiversity, Brazil, which in turn, allows them to experience and value ingredients that were historically underutilized by the food industry. The appreciation of the Brazilian biodiversity opens many opportunities, but also puts more responsibility on our shoulders, for they have to consider the use of sustainable resources.\n \n Offering access to natural and organic products, caring for people and the planet, is our way to validate the belief that the company should continue operating in an economically sustainable manner.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Emerging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food

Faro's customers save on energy bills, reduce energy price volatility and increase independence from the grid. Faro's investors benefit from stable, long term returns on their investment.\n\nFaro Energy partners with a network of local engineers and developers across the region, bringing together the best local knowledge and engineering skills with international capital and solar expertise.\n \nFaro Energy was known as Iwana Energy until June 2016\n \nFaro Energy aims to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy, by bringing innovative solar financing models to new markets.\n \nIn many emerging markets, solar is already cost-competitive with grid power without subsidy. However, most energy consumers (of all sizes) want to pay for their energy as they use it rather than incurring large upfront costs. This makes lack of access to capital is one of the biggest barriers to rapid roll-out of solar.\n \nUltimately, Faro aims to catalyse a large scale shift in global capital flows to a low carbon economy, by creating attractive, large scale investment opportunities - turning clean energy infrastructure in developing countries into a mainstream investment

Faro's customers save on energy bills, reduce energy price volatility and increase independence from the grid. Faro's investors benefit from stable, long term returns on their investment.\n\nFaro Energy partners with a network of local engineers and developers across the region, bringing together the best local knowledge and engineering skills with international capital and solar expertise.\n \nFaro Energy was known as Iwana Energy until June 2016\n \nFaro Energy aims to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy, by bringing innovative solar financing models to new markets.\n \nIn many emerging markets, solar is already cost-competitive with grid power without subsidy. However, most energy consumers (of all sizes) want to pay for their energy as they use it rather than incurring large upfront costs. This makes lack of access to capital is one of the biggest barriers to rapid roll-out of solar.\n \nUltimately, Faro aims to catalyse a large scale shift in global capital flows to a low carbon economy, by creating attractive, large scale investment opportunities - turning clean energy infrastructure in developing countries into a mainstream investment asset.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Emerging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Solar panel

From supporting the qualification of local suppliers to supporting disadvantaged to structure their own small business communities.\n \n The Oficina da Sustentabilidade believes that when they work on a local scale, and think globally, they can create more appropriate solutions to the problems. Allowing companies to play a role of planning and structuring of territorial action strategies, is a major focus of the workshop, looking to increasingly involve communities in the business of large

It is safe to say all of the actions which Solberg does, will fall into one of these categories. The benefit of expanding people, planet and profit to seven is that there are more topics for which to relate to helping others grasp their sustainable passion.\n \n They are proud partners with DOE Better Buildings Better Plants, which is a voluntary goal to reduce their energy intensity by 25% over ten years. Their baseline year is 2008. This strategy is very helpful because they are proactively investigating ways to reduce their environmental footprint fundamentally helping labor efficiency, health and

and celebrate life. Our mantra, “COME TO LIFE” is an invitation to the regenerative movement - a movement embodied by personal, social, ecological and cultural regeneration. \n \nYerba mate is an infusion brewed from the emerald-green leaves of the Ilex paraguariensis (yerba mate) tree, which is native to the South American Atlantic Rainforest. Yerba mate has the strength of coffee, the health benefits of tea, and the euphoria of chocolate, all in one beverage. Of the six commonly used stimulants in the world: coffee, tea, kola, cocoa, and guarana, yerba mate triumphs as the most balanced and invigorating. Our yerba mate is shade-grown with Fair for Life and organic growing practices in Argentina, Paraguay and Southern Brazil. \n \nCome to life and learn more at guayaki.com.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Beverages","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"95472","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"guayaki gauyaki guayuki rainforest products mate yerba tea consumer products coffee caffeine rain forest brazil reforestation reforest carbon tribe indigenous whole foods beverage drink organic loose","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Argentina","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Brazil","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Paraguay","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1301011200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"84.7","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Sebastopol","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"95472","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Asuncion","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"British Colombia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Buenos Aires","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"CA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Florida","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Santiago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sao Paulo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Asuncion","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Buenos Aires","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Jacksonville Beach","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Salt Spring Island","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Santiago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sebastopol","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Turvo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"PendingCompanies","id":"1ae938ad-63e1-5ab0-afff-00d7323261ca","name":"Legend Wealth Management","slug":"legend-wealth-management","description":"A Legend Wealth Management nasceu para assegurar a perpetuação do legado econômico familiar e suas demandas complexas como a seleção de estruturas fiduciárias, escolha de ativos e recrutamento de prestadores de serviços diversos.
