From drying and freezing to cold cellars and canning, food-storing wisdom has been passed down through generational history.\n\nIn 2008, on a mission to extend the life of food naturally and without plastic, Toni Desrosiers invented Abeego—the first beeswax food wrap that breathes.

And it's a serious problem. From the top of Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and literally everywhere in between, microplastics are polluting the environment, wildlife and our bodies with toxic, synthetic chemicals. Life Without Plastic began in 2006 when pioneering co-founders Chantal and Jay couldn't find non-plastic products for their basic needs. The company offers safe, high quality, ethically-sourced and Earth-friendly alternatives to plastics for everyday life, including zero waste essentials. Life Without Plastic is a mission-based business actively working for positive social change, improved health, and environmental sustainability. Products are carefully designed and sourced from vetted and trusted suppliers.

This simple thought holds a bigger truth. It represents the way ACU does business, their promise to the members and a commitment to the communities they live and work in. ACU is guided by the principles of \"values-based banking\", meaning that the credit union remains financially strong while being socially, environmentally and ethically responsible.\n\nACU believes that money can and should, be used for good. To bring financial comfort, to help people's lives and to improve the environment.

Among the most direct ways they can limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use. Making the best product matters for saving the planet.\n\nCause no unnecessary harm\nThey know that their business activity—from lighting stores to dyeing shirts—is part of the problem. They work steadily to change their business practices and share what they’ve learned. But they recognize that this is not enough. They seek not only to do less harm, but more good.\n\nUse business to protect nature\nThe challenges faced as a society require leadership. Once they identify a problem, they act. They embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life.\n\nNot bound by convention\nTheir success—and much of the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"93001-2545","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"outdoor, apparel, clothes, climbing, sports, active lifestyle, skiing, running, climb, jackets, fleece, clothing, gear, activewear, hiking, surfing, bag, pack, shoes, outerwear, duffel, sweatshirt, t-shirt, wetsuit, layers","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Argentina","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Japan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"South Korea","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1324512000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"151.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Ventura","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"93001-2545","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Ventura","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"2331805b-3c6c-5cba-a6ae-7c595449f533","name":"Enviro-Stewards","slug":"enviro-stewards","description":"Enviro-Stewards Inc’s Engineers & Scientists serve as sustainability catalysts for industrial, commercial and institutional facilities.

They work with a variety of not-for-profits, educational groups, and organizations across the globe to ensure that their planting efforts are having a real, marked impact in the local communities. To date, they have already planted over 25 million trees and have a goal to plant 1 billion trees by 2030.\n\nWith millions of trees planted to date, the impact is easy to see. These trees have provided hundreds of thousands of days of employment in underprivileged communities across the globe which equates to several hundred full-time jobs. Not to mention the countless hours of education that have gone into making these projects a success. The environmental impact is truly astounding as these trees help rejuvenate damaged eco-systems and remove pollution from the atmosphere.

They work with a variety of not-for-profits, educational groups, and organizations across the globe to ensure that their planting efforts are having a real, marked impact in the local communities. To date, they have already planted over 25 million trees and have a goal to plant 1 billion trees by 2030.\n\nWith millions of trees planted to date, the impact is easy to see. These trees have provided hundreds of thousands of days of employment in underprivileged communities across the globe which equates to several hundred full-time jobs. Not to mention the countless hours of education that have gone into making these projects a success. The environmental impact is truly astounding as these trees help rejuvenate damaged eco-systems and remove pollution from the atmosphere.

We actively work on Circularity and Regeneration, not only of our packaging, ever lighter, made with recycled materials and according to the eco-design principles, but also of soils and ecosystems, promoting research and the use of regenerative farming practices. Finally, guided by the value of interdependence, we are committed to spreading the B Corp culture among our partners and stakeholders, supporting them in the certification so that more and more private sector players will join in the path towards a future of sustainability.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -

The organization’s mission is to provide Canadians with easy and practical 100% renewable energy solutions for their homes, businesses and transportation that empower them to create a sustainable world for future generations. A double-bottom line organization, Bullfrog Power donates 10% of its profits to organizations that support sustainability. In Bullfrog’s view, this is business as it should be—good for society as well as its shareholders.\n \nBullfrog's green electricity comes exclusively from wind and hydro facilities that have been certified as low impact by Environment Canada under its EcoLogoM program—instead of from polluting sources like coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear. A clean, renewable alternative to fossil-fuel based natural gas, Bullfrog's green natural gas is produced in Canada from biogas facilities that have met strict environmental criteria as defined by ICF International. By choosing Bullfrog Power's green energy, homes and businesses can reduce their environmental impact, support the development of new renewable generation in Canada and help to create a cleaner world for today and tomorrow.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other renewable energy installation","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"M5T3A3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"bull frog power, renewable energy, wind, hydro, canada powered sources of alternative energy wind turbine home green business electricity canada ontario ecologo biogas climate change provider toronto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1321833600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"112.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Ontario","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Toronto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"M5T3A3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Ontario","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Toronto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"f914b3df-32c7-54f3-a2a5-5b7a21836118","name":"Animikii","slug":"animikii","description":"Animikii works to drive social innovation for Indigenous Peoples and organizations through technology.

It’s a turnkey service, meaning they provide all the care and maintenance the bees need to thrive.\n\nTheir service includes a hands-on educational program where people participate in workshops to learn all about the role and impact of bees and pollinators on our everyday lives. At the end of the season, they harvest the extra honey produced by the bees and give it all back to their clients in jars with their own official logo, which they then share with their community and network to further spread awareness.\n\nAlvéole's goal is to make people fall in love with bees, which in turn will make them fall in love with nature, completely changing their sense of responsibility towards the environment. \n\nStarting January 2021, Alvéole has become a member of 1% For The Planet, committing to donating 1% of all its gross sales directly to environmental non-profits and greening initiatives in all communities where it operates.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other personal services","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"H2P 2R8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"urban beekeeping, urban honey, bees, pollinators, pollination, team-building, tenant engagement, education, connection, workshops, conferences","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1516147200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"111.8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Quebec","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Montreal","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"H2P 2R8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Illinois","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Quebec","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Île-de-France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Chicago","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Denver","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Montreal","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Saclay","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"cce91b9f-e998-53f8-b405-6a969f387d12","name":"The Raw Office","slug":"the-raw-office","description":"Raw Office saves businesses an average of 20% on supplies via its next generation procurement platform.
