Twins are a great constant for medical research and Alana and Lisa became the “chief guinea pigs” for Prof Tim Spector and the Twin Research department at Kings College, where they discovered that despite having 100% the same DNA their guts have only 30/40% the same microbiota. They made it their mission to bring the exciting information they were learning, to the masses (not just the “wellbeing aware” middle classes) and have since made www.thegutstuff.com the global millennial thought leader in the space. They knew as people devoured the information that they’d want to know which products to bring into their lives that were both efficacious, delicious and affordable, so have since launched a product range of snack bars, fermentation kits, gut diaries and resources and wrote a (best selling!) book (with number two on the way) with some of the top experts on gut health. With education still at its core they’ve built up a highly successful workplace wellness business, that pledges to educate schools and universities for free for every corporate business they work with.

In English : They help businesses and individuals benefit from the countless advantages of solar power without having to carry the costs in terms of financial and time investments. The biggest advantage is the alignment of objectives, as their income is directly linked to the day-to-day production of the panels, their partner companies are guaranteed to have the best and most functional installation. The more green energy is produced, the more money they save and the better their investment. Their success is linked to theirs. And the more successful they are, the better their impact on the environment! They take care of every aspect of the project from feasibility studies to permits, they invest in the solar power modules and oversee their installation. They take care of maintenance on the long run. They get a return on investment through the sale of electricity to the client at a discount (30% cheaper than the grid). Their clients benefit of renewable energy at a discount, saving on their energy bill while reducing their carbon footprint.
