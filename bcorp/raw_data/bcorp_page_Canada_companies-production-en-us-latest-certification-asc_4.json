This simple thought holds a bigger truth. It represents the way ACU does business, their promise to the members and a commitment to the communities they live and work in. ACU is guided by the principles of \"values-based banking\", meaning that the credit union remains financially strong while being socially, environmentally and ethically responsible.\n\nACU believes that money can and should, be used for good. To bring financial comfort, to help people's lives and to improve the environment. ACU is fortunate to be in a position to be able to use the credit union's expertise and resources to nurture self-reliant and sustainable communities, to help those less fortunate, and to help members achieve the quality of life they're seeking. All the while, ACU remains critically aware of the impact of business decisions on employees, members, the environment and on the communities their credit union serves.\n\nACU will never forget that their members are also the owners of Assiniboine Credit Union.

Nutritious food is a human right. Everyone should have access to nutrient dense and ingredient diverse foods. Good fats and low sugar should be the standard and not the exception. Fatso uses the cost effective peanut and a blend of almonds and seeds as a base to bring together good fats and fibre-focused ingredients without palm oil or sugar. We aim to provide more nutrition, benefits, and flavour, spoon-for-spoon, at a cost that is lower or competitive with high-priced specialty nut butters.\n\nFatso also ensures that a portion of their product goes to underserved communities in both Canada and the US. During the recent COVID 19 pandemic, Fatso donated over $200k worth of product to food banks, communities, and organizations that either had difficulty staying food secure or required funds to push their mission forward.\n\nFatso also maintains a strong commitment to social justice matters. We are committed to using our power, public profile, and product to help ensure the unheard, unserved, and unrepresented are acknowledged and lifted up. Our company aims to be inclusive, active, and supportive.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -
