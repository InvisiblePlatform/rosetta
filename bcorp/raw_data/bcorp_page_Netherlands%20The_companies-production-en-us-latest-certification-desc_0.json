As record-holders with the highest scores in the Netherlands for BREEAM, LEED, GPR and GreenCalc+, the office ensures that its own buildings meet the highest, proven standards of sustainability.\n \nPaul de Ruiter Architects takes its inspiration from the body of ideas expressed in the PhD research by Paul de Ruiter, “The Chameleon Skin” from 1992. He argued that buildings should produce rather than consume energy. Paul de Ruiter's architecture generates energy in technical terms, but also for the people working and living within them. Their buildings value happiness and inspiration, and they have found that daylight optimization fosters intelligence and sustainability. Thus, the company designs buildings with a pleasant indoor climate in which health, interaction and human communication take centre stage.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Architecture design & planning","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"1059CD","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Architecture, sustainability, autarkic, Net Zero energy, Health, Daylight, Cradle to Cradle, Circular Economy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1454976000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"82.3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"North Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"1059CD","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"North Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"8fcf943f-02ed-5591-85ed-892e4f9ab007","name":"Cause4","slug":"cause4","description":"Cause4 champions disruptive philanthropy and new ways of scaling up charities and social enterprises supporting them to change and grow.

Tony's also pays a higher cocoa price that enables cocoa farmers to earn a living. By investing in long-term partnerships and working directly with cocoa cooperatives, as well as working on quality and productivity together with the farmers, Tony's aims to make cocoa farming structurally more sustainable.\nTony's Chocolonely shows that it is possible to make chocolate differently and inspires other to do the same.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Food

By investing in long-term partnerships and working directly with cocoa cooperatives, as well as working on quality and productivity together with the farmers, Tony's aims to make cocoa farming structurally more sustainable.\nTony's Chocolonely shows that it is possible to make chocolate differently and inspires other to do the same.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"1014DA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Tony's, Tony's Chocolonely, chocolate, slave free, serious, crazy, 100% slave free, tasty, west africa, ghana, ivory coast, modern slavery, fair, Teun, cocoa","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Austria","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Belgium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ghana","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1387756800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"125.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Noord-Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"1014DA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Hamburg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Noord Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Noord-Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Amsterdam ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Hamburg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York City ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"eaf42fa0-da18-56be-8068-c6298555a29f","name":"Cloud for Good","slug":"cloud-good","description":"With hundreds of custom Salesforce implementations, Cloud for Good is the leading Salesforce consulting partner for nonprofit and educational organizations.Their Salesforce.com certified consultants can help you with:New implementations, from Quickstart to multi-system data migrationsEvaluation of your current Salesforce.com database and its use, with strategic guidance towards better data & higher adoption ratesIntegrating legacy databases, external systems, and public-facing websites through custom programming or AppExchange partnersCustom apps development on the force.com platform, designed from scratch to meet your business needsCustom training for end-users and administrators, or as-you-need-it support contracts.\n \n Cloud for Good seeks a world in which nonprofit organizations are using technology to become more effective and efficient in their mission.

The approach they take toward product design demonstrates a bias for simplicity and utility.\n\nBuild the best product\nTheir criteria for the best product rests on function, repairability, and, foremost, durability. Among the most direct ways they can limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use. Making the best product matters for saving the planet.\n\nCause no unnecessary harm\nThey know that their business activity—from lighting stores to dyeing shirts—is part of the problem. They work steadily to change their business practices and share what they’ve learned. But they recognize that this is not enough. They seek not only to do less harm, but more good.\n\nUse business to protect nature\nThe challenges faced as a society require leadership. Once they identify a problem, they act. They embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life.\n\nNot bound by convention\nTheir success—and much of the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things.","market":"Developed","industry":"Apparel","sector":"Wholesale/Retail","operatingCountry":"United

The approach they take toward product design demonstrates a bias for simplicity and utility.\n\nBuild the best product\nTheir criteria for the best product rests on function, repairability, and, foremost, durability. Among the most direct ways they can limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use. Making the best product matters for saving the planet.\n\nCause no unnecessary harm\nThey know that their business activity—from lighting stores to dyeing shirts—is part of the problem. They work steadily to change their business practices and share what they’ve learned. But they recognize that this is not enough. They seek not only to do less harm, but more good.\n\nUse business to protect nature\nThe challenges faced as a society require leadership. Once they identify a problem, they act. They embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life.\n\nNot bound by convention\nTheir success—and much of the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"93001-2545","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"outdoor, apparel, clothes, climbing, sports, active lifestyle, skiing, running, climb, jackets, fleece, clothing, gear, activewear, hiking, surfing, bag, pack, shoes, outerwear, duffel, sweatshirt, t-shirt, wetsuit, layers","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Argentina","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Japan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"South Korea","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1324512000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"151.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Ventura","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"93001-2545","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Ventura","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"8a6e9e76-e516-5ad0-b38a-ce2ef7a699b3","name":"Sarona Asset Management Inc","slug":"sarona-asset-management-inc","description":"With a rich history stretching back to 1953, Sarona has extensive experience investing in Frontier and Emerging Markets.
