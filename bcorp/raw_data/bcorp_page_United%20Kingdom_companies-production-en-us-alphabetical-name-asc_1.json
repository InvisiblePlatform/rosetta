into our lives. They make innovative and exciting chocolate but aim to keep it as simple as possible. There are no hidden ingredients and nothing artificial, just superdelicious, real chocolate.\n \nEach bar is lovingly hand-crafted in the UK using the best quality, organic ingredients, ethically sourced from all over the world. Their chocolate is gluten-free, soya-free, their dark range is vegan and all of them are jam-packed full of nature’s superfoods. They believe in a balanced lifestyle, of which treats (especially chocolate) are one part. Every bar of D&D has a superfood, a unique taste and an irresistible texture. Their bars never have more than eight ingredients, minimum 8% superfoods and have a high cocoa content to squeeze out the room for sugar and fat. It’s healthy indulgence at its best.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"SW8 5EL","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Chocolate, Superfoods, Organic, Ethical","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1491264000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"93.3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"SW8 5EL","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"f044da1b-004c-5c11-8ba9-e2e2ed1934a2","name":"Don't Cry Wolf","slug":"dont-cry-wolf","description":"A brand activism agency delivering creative campaigns, branding, production and PR for brandas that want to stand for something.","market":"Developed -

After a distinguished career fighting fires and saving lives the hoses were destined for landfill. They started to rescue the hoses in 2005 and never looked back.\n \nMore materials soon followed, Kresse has always had an obsession with waste and likes nothing better than discovering and intercepting something new. The challenge is the same every time - what can be done to prove value, change perception, and respect these resources.\n\nToday, Elvis & Kresse's highly skilled craftspeople make beautifully designed bags and homeware. 50% of Elvis & Kresse's profits are donated to charities related to their raw materials, 50% of their profits from the fire hose range go to The Fire Fighters Charity. London's fire hose was just the beginning, the team reclaims more than 12 different materials and has saved over 300 tonnes of material from landfill.","market":"Emerging","industry":"Leather &

fire-hose. After a distinguished career fighting fires and saving lives the hoses were destined for landfill. They started to rescue the hoses in 2005 and never looked back.\n \nMore materials soon followed, Kresse has always had an obsession with waste and likes nothing better than discovering and intercepting something new. The challenge is the same every time - what can be done to prove value, change perception, and respect these resources.\n\nToday, Elvis & Kresse's highly skilled craftspeople make beautifully designed bags and homeware. 50% of Elvis & Kresse's profits are donated to charities related to their raw materials, 50% of their profits from the fire hose range go to The Fire Fighters Charity. London's fire hose was just the beginning, the team reclaims more than 12 different materials and has saved over 300 tonnes of material from landfill.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Emerging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Leather & related products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"ME13 0RU","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"fire hose, recycle, reclaim, donation, innovation, circular economy, renewable energy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Turkey","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1438560000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"147.6","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Kent","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Painters Forstal","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"ME13 0RU","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Kent","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Painters Forstal","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"d9263203-ad0f-5a53-8121-6d820cba1ccb","name":"Emitwise","slug":"emitwise","description":"Emitwise is the carbon management platform for manufacturing businesses and supply chains to confidently understand, track, and reduce their carbon footprint.

They have also achieved a BRC Food Safety AA standard for our brewing and bottling operations in 2019.\n\nThe Equinox range is diverse, with different flavour profiles as well as key Kombucha innovation such as our Coffee Kombucha which is fermented made from a coffee base liquid rather than tea. They have also just launched a new range of organic Kombucha flavours with River Cottage!\n\nTheir business ethics are part and parcel of everything we do. They have just been certified as a B Corp and plan to deliver sustainable growth, employment, and progression for our local community in Calderdale as we move into the next year. \n\nTheir aim is to be a national challenger brand and health champion in the UK and Europe.

Relocating to Cornwall, the couple launched with the Birdball birdhouse, a spherical, ceramic birdhouse inspired by the true form of nature. The Birdball birdhouse went on to win design awards from Wayne Hemingway and to be stocked by prestigious names like the Conran shop.\n\nIn 2014, after several years of prototyping and testing, Green&Blue launched the Bee Brick, a concrete nesting site for solitary bees, designed to be used in place of a standard brick or block in construction, as well as freestanding in the garden. Again, Bee Brick was inspired by the way in which historically solitary bees nest in old crumbling walls, which are fast disappearing as we build ever more 'perfect' properties. Bee Brick won the Soil Association Innovation award that same year. \n\nGreen&Blue are on a mission to make homes havens for wildlife and have a vision of reconnecting people with nature, supported by the products they manufacture and the awareness they spread of our wildlife and the natural world.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Other

husband and wife team Gavin and Kate Christman, who met whilst working at Dyson. Relocating to Cornwall, the couple launched with the Birdball birdhouse, a spherical, ceramic birdhouse inspired by the true form of nature. The Birdball birdhouse went on to win design awards from Wayne Hemingway and to be stocked by prestigious names like the Conran shop.\n\nIn 2014, after several years of prototyping and testing, Green&Blue launched the Bee Brick, a concrete nesting site for solitary bees, designed to be used in place of a standard brick or block in construction, as well as freestanding in the garden. Again, Bee Brick was inspired by the way in which historically solitary bees nest in old crumbling walls, which are fast disappearing as we build ever more 'perfect' properties. Bee Brick won the Soil Association Innovation award that same year. \n\nGreen&Blue are on a mission to make homes havens for wildlife and have a vision of reconnecting people with nature, supported by the products they manufacture and the awareness they spread of our wildlife and the natural world.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -
