Founded in 2017, cofounders Saba Williams and Olayinka Credle set out to address the iniquities experienced by people of color within the beauty industry and bring awareness to the climate crisis. Using clean ingredients and sustainable packaging, Melanin Essentials seeks to combat the issue of the environmental and health hazards caused by plastic waste and toxic beauty.\n\nBy definition, Melanin means, pigments that give hair, skin, and eyes their color. No matter what obstacles one may face being their most natural self, Melanin Essentials wants their customers to experience the same revelation that allowed the cofounders to embrace their natural beauty: “God makes no mistakes with his creation”. No matter how light or dark the skin or eyes, no matter kinky or curly the hair, Melanin Essentials celebrates the fact that – we all have melanin.

dedicado al abasto responsable de alimentos regionales, preservados por generaciones de agricultores de México. Colaboramos en la construcción de un nuevo sistema alimentario a partir de alianzas con familias, grupos y cooperativas campesinas. Aseguramos compensaciones dignas comercializando únicamente excedentes de producción familiar y construyendo nuevos canales de distribución para poder llevar alimentos variados y deliciosos a las mesas de nuestras casas y restaurantes. Hoy trabajamos directamente con agricultores que preservan más de 50 especies y variedades de maíz, frijol, chile y cacao provenientes del Estado de México, Chiapas, Guerrero, Tabasco, Tlaxcala, Oaxaca, Yucatán, Veracruz y Michoacán.

Their honey is sourced from hives in designated forest reserves where no agriculture is possible. They work with local government authorities to protect these forest reserves from agriculture encroachment or from cutting trees for charcoal production. Their activity helps protect native woodlands, and their products are fully traceable right back to the beekeeper in the forest. Beekeepers in Western Tanzania are some of the poorest people on the planet. Through training, certification and Upendo Honey’s international reach, beekeepers' incomes increase: buying from Upendo Honey creates jobs and prosperity in remote communities that have little of either. As the largest private sector employer in the Kigoma region, Upendo Honey provides good paying jobs in a region and country where they are rare.
