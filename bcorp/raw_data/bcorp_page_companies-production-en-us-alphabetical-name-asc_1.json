Headquartered in Lewiston, the Bank has been fiercely independent for 150 years offering innovative banking solutions to meet clients’ individual needs. Androscoggin Bank is Member FDIC.\n\nAndroscoggin Bank is part of a small number of banks nationally who share in their commitment to leverage business as a force of good in their world. This means moving beyond stereotypical mindsets by challenging themselves to reimagine and reinvent the experience of community banking for their clients, employees, and community partners, while also honoring the environment.\n\nThey'll continue to use profit to power purpose, rather than serving as the purpose itself. They believe that business – including banking – should aim higher and seek to create meaningful value for multiple stakeholders.\n\nIt’s a signal to their business partners, clients, and communities that their money’s not only in safe hands, but caring ones as well.

Arbos transforms these \"poor\" materials into everyday products in close and constant partnership with the world of design and art. Just as the Italians are insurmountable in other fields -like fashion and food - for its paper products Arbos wants to express the “Made in Italy” quality: creativity, design, art and the great know-how of our craftsmanship.\n\nAt the same time, the eco-sustainable materials mean that anyone who purchases products by Arbos knows that the environment comes first and foremost. An Arbos notebook or journal offers the right stimulus for writing or drawing; the ideal place for collecting ideas and feelings. And to keep them. This is why Arbos says that their products are stories: they speak of Respect for the environment, Respect for man, and Research into beauty.

With the production of environmentally-friendly textile pulp and the use of the side streams resulting from this in the form of bioenergy, they have positioned themselves as a forward-thinking industrial company. They produce 155,000 tons of pulp for the textile industry and other uses. Up to 20,000 households in Hallein and Salzburg are provided with the bioenergy we generate.\nTheir core business is the efficient, sustainable and environmentally-friendly use of the raw material wood, which is used to produce high-quality textile pulp and bioenergy. They employ 246 workers at our Hallein site (15 km south of the city of Salzburg).\n\nThey use spruce wood (long fibre) from sustainably managed forests. Using various processes, they produce high-purity pulp to manufacture textile fibres (viscose). More than 60 million euros have been invested in their systems and processes. From the side streams of cellulose production, they gain green energy, district heating, biogas and lignosulphonate.

A Climate Positive calvados, removing 2.73kg/CO2e per bottle, while saving the bees (a proportion of revenue from every bottle sold is donated to charities that support the protection of bees). Avallen is made with no added sugar and minimal processing, so this spirit tastes as good as it is to the planet!\n\nWhat is Avallen? It is a natural, fruity and floral calvados made with over 40 different varieties of apples. It’s produced in the West of Normandy, and aged for a minimum of two years in French Oak before being bottled with no added sugar or nasties! A seriously fresh take in the world of calvados.\n\nFloral aromas of fresh apples and honeysuckle on the nose, lead to a palate filled with flavours of toffee apple.
