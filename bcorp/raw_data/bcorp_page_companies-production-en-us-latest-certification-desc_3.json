Originally, SoLo launched as an on-demand marketplace where members can request and fund loans for emergency needs. To date, they’ve processed millions of transactions, providing a lending alternative that is equitable, empowering, and community-driven. Solo is now building a community-driven financial technology company to further serve the needs of the underrepresented. For more info: www.solofunds.com\n\nFounded by African American founders, Rodney Williams and Travis Holloway leveraged their personal experiences to build a community based financial solution reimagining how financial service could best serve their communities.  Like many Americans, Travis and Rodney were no strangers to having their electricity being turned off in the winter two days before payday. Knowing how far just a few dollars can go, SoLo was built to address a core need while establishing a pathway to financial autonomy.\n\nSoLo is the only Black-owned financial services Certified B Corp in US & Canada.
