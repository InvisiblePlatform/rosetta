With their ultra-thin and flexible sole they are designed to help our bodies regenerate and to aid the rediscovery of the joy of moving naturally. Inspired by the principles of nature, we want to translate the regenerative impact of our shoes to our organization and the way we all do business.\nIn this transformation we have to question everything: How we produce shoes. How we cooperate in supply chains. How we value resources and manage them in cycles. How we work together in a fulfilling way. How we foster personal and community development.

Twins are a great constant for medical research and Alana and Lisa became the “chief guinea pigs” for Prof Tim Spector and the Twin Research department at Kings College, where they discovered that despite having 100% the same DNA their guts have only 30/40% the same microbiota. They made it their mission to bring the exciting information they were learning, to the masses (not just the “wellbeing aware” middle classes) and have since made www.thegutstuff.com the global millennial thought leader in the space. They knew as people devoured the information that they’d want to know which products to bring into their lives that were both efficacious, delicious and affordable, so have since launched a product range of snack bars, fermentation kits, gut diaries and resources and wrote a (best selling!) book (with number two on the way) with some of the top experts on gut health. With education still at its core they’ve built up a highly successful workplace wellness business, that pledges to educate schools and universities for free for every corporate business they work with.

We specialize in uncovering the hidden stories and crafting compelling films that win hearts, change minds, and shift culture.\n\nFor the past 7 years, we’ve had the opportunity to create content for some of the world’s largest brands, created action for community-based non-profits, supported unique arts initiatives, collaborated with remarkable production companies, and partnered with amazing agencies.  \n\nWe’ve filmed projects in 27 different countries on almost every continent. We like to think it’s a pretty cool resume. \n\nThrough our adventures, the one thing that always stuck with us are the countless unique and memorable people we’ve met.  In learning their stories, it’s pushed us deeper and deeper into our passion to tell real, documentary-style stories. \n\nSure, we could script our own but we believe there is unmatched power in real human stories. Each one is a winding journey of ups and downs.
