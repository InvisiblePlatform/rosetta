Team Unico is the realisation of Australian Culture, with all of our products honouring the uniqueness and fragility of our land - whether that’s utilising grape varieties that can be dry-grown in desert-like environments or playing around with native Australian botanicals in Gin and Amaro. \n\nIn 2013, they began making Unico Zelo Wines in the Old Gumeracha Coldstores and launched Applewood Distillery Gin soon after in 2015. Team Unico gradually renovated the coldstores and in mid-2017, opened the Applewood Distillery Bar. They have since created Harvest Social Cantina, Carter’s Coffee Liqueur and Økar Island Bitter.\n\nThey hope to assist a disconnected world to reestablish a curiosity and adoration for the land we all collectively belong to, via the sharing of drinks crafted of the land with food, family and friends - building a global community in the process.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Agricultural Processing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Agriculture/Growers","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"5233","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"winery, distillery, australia, adelaide hills, applewood distillery, unico zelo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1564704000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"81.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"South Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Gumeracha","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"5233","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"South Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Gumeracha","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"St Marys","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"45823218-6747-589e-bfb1-4aa57871b2e1","name":"Triple P International Pty Ltd","slug":"triple-p-international-pty-ltd","description":"Licensed to disseminate the Triple P Ð Positive Parenting Program,Triple P International is committed to putting evidence-based parenting in the hands of every parent around the world.\n \n Talk to the staff at Triple P International in Australia (or at Triple P America, Triple P UK, Triple P Latam, Triple P Parenting Canada, Triple P Deutschland, Triple P in Hong Kong, or Triple P New Zealand) about why they work where they do and a common theme emerges.

The approach they take toward product design demonstrates a bias for simplicity and utility.\n\nBuild the best product\nTheir criteria for the best product rests on function, repairability, and, foremost, durability. Among the most direct ways they can limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use. Making the best product matters for saving the planet.\n\nCause no unnecessary harm\nThey know that their business activity—from lighting stores to dyeing shirts—is part of the problem. They work steadily to change their business practices and share what they’ve learned. But they recognize that this is not enough. They seek not only to do less harm, but more good.\n\nUse business to protect nature\nThe challenges faced as a society require leadership. Once they identify a problem, they act. They embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life.\n\nNot bound by convention\nTheir success—and much of the fun—lies in developing new ways to do

Among the most direct ways they can limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use. Making the best product matters for saving the planet.\n\nCause no unnecessary harm\nThey know that their business activity—from lighting stores to dyeing shirts—is part of the problem. They work steadily to change their business practices and share what they’ve learned. But they recognize that this is not enough. They seek not only to do less harm, but more good.\n\nUse business to protect nature\nThe challenges faced as a society require leadership. Once they identify a problem, they act. They embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life.\n\nNot bound by convention\nTheir success—and much of the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"93001-2545","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"outdoor, apparel, clothes, climbing, sports, active lifestyle, skiing, running, climb, jackets, fleece, clothing, gear, activewear, hiking, surfing, bag, pack, shoes, outerwear, duffel, sweatshirt, t-shirt, wetsuit, layers","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Argentina","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Japan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"South Korea","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1324512000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"151.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Ventura","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"93001-2545","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Ventura","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"60341fef-f318-5c17-a6d3-5b91bfb9181f","name":"Hepburn Energy","slug":"hepburn-wind","description":"Hepburn Wind is the owner and operator of Australia’s first community-owned wind farm. \n\nHepburn Wind is located at Leonards Hill, about 100km north-west of Melbourne, just south of Daylesford Victoria.

Our ultimate goal is that the revenue generated from our projects can be effectively reinvested in the restoration and regeneration of the world’s most fragile ecosystems.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Equity investing - Developed Markets","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"1076 DE Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Circular Economy, Conservation, Regenerative, Finance, Equity, Environmental, Social","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Belgium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Botswana","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Cambodia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Colombia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Costa Rica","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ecuador","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Italy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Japan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Namibia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Peru","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Portugal","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Spain","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sri Lanka","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Thailand","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1626134400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"139.7","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Noord Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"1076 DE Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Noord Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"9b00cf4f-bdf7-5b0f-ad11-9bfbe9ed808f","name":"Coconut Bowls","slug":"coconut-bowls","description":"Coconut Bowls helps you connect with nature, and live a healthier, happier & more sustainable lifestyle.

We will protect what should be preserved. \n\nWe believe that with a great passion for nature and people comes great responsibility, to market and build stuff responsibly and protect nature for generations to come.\n\nFour Drunk Parrots is a MarTech company putting purpose before profit to help businesses (and the planet) thrive. Marketing has become incredibly technical, and this is where we come in. We solve tech problems for marketers and market companies through cutting edge strategies and technologies.\n\nWe have built a multi-disciplinary team of strategic thinkers, technologists, designers, and storytellers who deliver omni-channel web and media solutions for a better world. \n\nBased in Ballina and Darwin we are proudly local while working virtually with brands from interstate and across the world.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Advertising & market research","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"2478","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Marketing, Strategic Marketing Team, Leadership, Branding, Digital Transformation, MarTech, Webdesign, Web Development, eCommerce, Creative, Graphic Design, PPC, SEO, Inbound Marketing, Social Media, ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1632614400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"125.7","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Australia","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New South Wales","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Ballina","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"2478","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"New South Wales","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Ballina","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"3df77279-9937-5927-9183-e4cac73ca228","name":"U Ethical","slug":"uca-funds-management","description":"U Ethical is an investment manager with a difference.
