Since then, their dreams have got bigger and bigger (while their drinks have stayed about the same size).  \n\nWith dreams to keep people healthy while making sure  communities and our planet are healthy too. It's the reason why they became a B Corp, committed to being carbon neutral by 2025, always give 10% of our profits to people and planet and are working their socks off to make farming more sustainable.  \n\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Beverages","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"W10 5BU","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Juice, smoothies and other healthy drinks","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Austria","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Belgium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"China","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Denmark","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Finland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"France","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Hong Kong S.A.R.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ireland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Italy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Japan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Malta","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Norway","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Portugal","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Spain","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sweden","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Switzerland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Arab Emirates","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1529366400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"105.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"W10 5BU","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Copenhagen","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Dublin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Hong Kong","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Madrid","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Milan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Munich","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Paris","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Rotterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Salzburg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Shanghai","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Stockholm","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Tokyo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Vienna","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"not listed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Copenhagen","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Dublin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Hong Kong","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Madrid","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Milan","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Munich","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Paris","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Rotterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Salzburg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Shanghai","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Stockholm","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Tokyo","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Vienna","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"811060b6-146b-52c2-911b-6d7c3697a3a7","name":"Intrepid Travel","slug":"intrepid-group-ltd","description":"We’ve travelled a long way to be here, and we’re so glad we did.\n\nSince Intrepid’s humble beginnings in 1989, our founders have been passionate about creating positive change through the joy of travel, creating experiences that benefit both people, and the planet.

heart of all it does for almost 40 years, taking into account the interest of all our stakeholders, not just shareholders. Alpro’s vision is of a world where more of what we eat comes directly from plants. Why? Because a plant-based lifestyle tastes good in every sense – it’s more sustainable for the planet, and eating more food from plants is good for our health.\n\nBy bringing innovative and tasty plant-based food and drink products to millions of consumers, Alpro is growing its business while tackling the health challenges of both people and the planet, thus creating both economic and social value. For Alpro, every time we eat and drink, we vote for the world we want to live in.\n\nThis vision aligns very well with the vision of our parent company Danone, summarized in Danone, One Planet.

Since 2006, Les 2 Vaches has been committed to developing strong partnerships with organic farmers, and encourage organic conversions. Year after year, Les 2 Vaches has been working on the quality of their products, by shortening the ingredients list, and being transparent on the ingredients sourcing. Not to mention the cows, for which a welfare program has been created. By embracing a joyful and educational spirit we’ve been increasing awareness of organic and sustainable consumption.

This best represents the Davines Group, a professional cosmetics company made in Italy, to which the Davines and Comfort Zone brands belong. B Corp since 2016 and Benefit Corporation since 2019, we have always encouraged a business model capable of generating not only profit but also a positive impact on the people, environment, and communities in which it operates. This led us in 2018 to become a Carbon Neutral Company, and today to commit ourselves to achieving Zero Net Emissions by 2030. We actively work on Circularity and Regeneration, not only of our packaging, ever lighter, made with recycled materials and according to the eco-design principles, but also of soils and ecosystems, promoting research and the use of regenerative farming practices.

SQUIZ has proven that it's possible to make consumer products locally and profitably. Since their commercial launch, SQUIZ has prevented the creation of over 50 tons of non-recyclable consumer waste through the use of their reusable pouches.\n\n Beginning in the prototype stage, the founders carefully considered the impact of their products in terms of environmental health and the social role of the company they wanted to create. The question was not only: ÒHow would this benefit the company?Ó but especially: ÒWhat benefit could the company bring to others?Ó With strong values deeply rooted in sustainable development as well as social responsibility, SQUIZ seeks to provide ethical products for all ages, to support charitable projects, and to be a driving force in the reduction of household waste.","market":"Developed -

They use Spark to attract, retain and engage today’s workers by connecting people personally to causes that matter to them. With more than 2 million users around the world, Benevity will process donations benefitting more than 100,000 global charities this year. As a certified B Corporation, Benevity joins a new breed of for-profit companies with a social mission who are setting the standard for doing well by doing good.\n\nBenevity hopes to use their technology through multiple integrations to make giving to the charity of one’s choice as convenient and prevalent as leaving a tip at a restaurant. Benevity envisions a reshaping of the notion and execution of personal and corporate philanthropy that sees it embedded into a variety of everyday consumptive and commercial activities. In such a landscape, people from all demographics – regardless of their means – can give money, time, goods, etc. to the social causes of their choice, while corporations better utilize their resources and influence to do the same in a virtuous circle.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -
