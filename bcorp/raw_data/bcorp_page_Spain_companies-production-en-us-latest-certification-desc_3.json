Benevity envisions a reshaping of the notion and execution of personal and corporate philanthropy that sees it embedded into a variety of everyday consumptive and commercial activities. In such a landscape, people from all demographics – regardless of their means – can give money, time, goods, etc. to the social causes of their choice, while corporations better utilize their

They use Spark to attract, retain and engage today’s workers by connecting people personally to causes that matter to them. With more than 2 million users around the world, Benevity will process donations benefitting more than 100,000 global charities this year. As a certified B Corporation, Benevity joins a new breed of for-profit companies with a social mission who are setting the standard for doing well by doing good.\n\nBenevity hopes to use their technology through multiple integrations to make giving to the charity of one’s choice as convenient and prevalent as leaving a tip at a restaurant. Benevity envisions a reshaping of the notion and execution of personal and corporate philanthropy that sees it embedded into a variety of everyday consumptive and commercial activities. In such a landscape, people from all demographics – regardless of their means – can give money, time, goods, etc. to the social causes of their choice, while corporations better utilize their resources and influence to do the same in a virtuous circle.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -
