They are pioneers in the re-use and recycling of unwanted books, reusing around 12 million books and recycling about 80 million books each year, an equivalent saving to 500,000 trees.\n\nWorld of Books purchases significant volumes of waste and surplus books from charity shops throughout the UK and Ireland – boosting revenues for these good causes and saving them waste disposal costs. This business model now generates over £3m of value for UK charities every year.\n\nWorld of Books Group is comprised of three direct-to-consumer e-commerce businesses (World of Books, World of Rare Books and Ziffit) each supported by their own technology.\n\nZiffit.com is a free and easy to use website and app to sell unwanted books, CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays and games for cash. Over 600,000 items are traded in each month, making it one of the largest trade-in sites in the UK. This business model is almost 100% circular.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Books or other media","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"BN12 4QY","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"used books, book seller, ecommerce, retail, world of books, wob, ziffit, ziffit.com, circular economy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1570665600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"84.8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"WEST SUSSEX","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Goring-by-Sea","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"BN12 4QY","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"WEST SUSSEX","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Goring-by-Sea","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"1cc30585-634d-5941-a8f8-cd49b1a16f29","name":"World Leadership School","slug":"world-leadership-school","description":"The mission of World Leadership School is to empower young leaders to find innovative solutions to the worldÕs pressing problems.

In the Vineyard De Reestlandhoeve plays classic music. There are several studies that demonstrate that plants respond well to calm, classical music. Plants grow stronger and are consequently less susceptible to various diseases. Whenever the weather conditions are bad – storms, rain, cold - , then the vines certainly have difficulty with that. The music can alleviate these external influences somewhat but can certainly not compensate for it entirely.

WholeTrees Structural Products are pre-engineered wood components made from unmilled round timbers, a byproduct of sustainable forest management. These assemblies utilize 4\"-24\" diameter trees that are 50% stronger than their comparably sized milled lumber counterparts. As part of WholeTrees' engineered structural systems, these timbers provide a low embodied energy and high CO2 capture alternative to steel, recycled steel and traditional milled lumber. Product packages come with engineer-stamped shop drawings, designed steel connection details, and easy installation guidelines. WholeTrees also offers installation services nationally, and its products fit in Type II, III, IV, and V construction and are definable as Heavy Timber within the International Building Code.\n \n The Madison, WI-based company was founded in 2007 by architect Roald Gundersen, AIA, and Amelia Baxter. WholeTrees provides design services and products for custom applications of timber in construction; engineering and consultation; project management and sub-contracting; and cutting-edge research and development of technologies that enable the forest products industry to sell round-timber.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Wood & wood products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"53703","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"timber, sustainability, architecture, building, construction, carpentry, woodworking, materials","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1492473600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"80.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Wisconsin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Madison","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"53703","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"WI","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Wisconsin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Madison","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"4c4fd211-5e0f-565f-89bb-304d182047d4","name":"Wholegrain Digital","slug":"wholegrain-digital","description":"Wholegrain Digital is London’s original WordPress website design and development agency, driven by a belief that the web should be sustainable, accessible, fast and fun.  \n\nFounded in 2007, they’ve since worked with clients in 38 countries across the world, building strong relationships with organisations that have similar values like Ecover, Network Rail, Article 19, Solarcentury and UNICEF.\n\nTheir team are a diverse bunch of WordPress and design fanatics, dedicated to helping you achieve the most out of your website.

The firm's founder, Deb Wetherby, wanted to create a new model that rewarded objectivity and results and eschewed the product and sales-driven culture present in most firms at that time. She made the decision to separate fees from investment recommendations, a novel idea that became the industry standard. Wetherby has no internal products and prides itself on offering objective investment advice to clients. \n \nGrowth of the firm has been centered on the founding values of independence, objectivity and exceptional client service. These tenets were especially crucial in Wetherby's early embrace of impact investing, enabling the firm to be flexible and respond to client demand for investments that could align their portfolio with their values. Wetherby is dedicated to ensuring these founding principles remain part of the firm's culture into the future thus our owners periodically offers key employees the opportunity to become owners of the business.","market":"Developed","industry":"Investment advising","sector":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","operatingCountry":"United

The firm's founder, Deb Wetherby, wanted to create a new model that rewarded objectivity and results and eschewed the product and sales-driven culture present in most firms at that time. She made the decision to separate fees from investment recommendations, a novel idea that became the industry standard. Wetherby has no internal products and prides itself on offering objective investment advice to clients. \n \nGrowth of the firm has been centered on the founding values of independence, objectivity and exceptional client service. These tenets were especially crucial in Wetherby's early embrace of impact investing, enabling the firm to be flexible and respond to client demand for investments that could align their portfolio with their values. Wetherby is dedicated to ensuring these founding principles remain part of the firm's culture into the future thus our owners periodically offers key employees the opportunity to become owners of the business.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Investment advising","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"94104","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1461801600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"120.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"San Francisco","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"94104","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Los Angeles","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"San Francisco","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"cca93c42-0e51-5360-bfd8-fa2e13c49c57","name":"Westwood International","slug":"westwood-international","description":"Founded by Greg Zlevor, Westwood International is a consulting collaborative that is reimagining what it means to lead wisely in a global age.

The lifestyle brand aims to demonstrate that a business can scale, be profitable, and do good in the world— without charging a premium for it. \n\nSince the day the company launched in 2010, Warby Parker has pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. They offer everything you need for happier eyes at a price that leaves you with money in your pocket, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests, and you can meet them online, at their stores, or even in your home. Wherever and whenever you need it, Warby Parker is there to make exceptional vision care simple and accessible. (Delightful, too.) \n\nUltimately, Warby Parker believes in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses they sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through Warby Parker’s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program. As of 2020, over eight million pairs have been distributed.","market":"Developed","industry":"Other retail sale","sector":"Wholesale/Retail","operatingCountry":"United States","operatingProvince":"New

Parker","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"description":{"value":"Warby Parker was founded with a mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style. \n\nWarby Parker is constantly asking how they can do more and make a greater impact—and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. The lifestyle brand aims to demonstrate that a business can scale, be profitable, and do good in the world— without charging a premium for it. \n\nSince the day the company launched in 2010, Warby Parker has pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. They offer everything you need for happier eyes at a price that leaves you with money in your pocket, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests, and you can meet them online, at their stores, or even in your home. Wherever and whenever you need it, Warby Parker is there to make exceptional vision care simple and accessible. (Delightful, too.) \n\nUltimately, Warby Parker believes in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses they sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through Warby Parker’s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program. As of 2020, over eight million pairs have been distributed.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other

Wallaroo prides itself on being a leader in the fashion-forward, sun protective hat industry, combining the latest fabrics and designs with maximum sun protection. Many of the hats in the Wallaroo Collection are rated UPF 50+ ensuring that the customer gets a 97.5% UV block from the sun's harmful rays. With the incidence of skin cancer on the rise nationally, sun protection is more important now than ever before. Wallaroo is actively involved with the Skin Cancer Foundation and many Wallaroo hats are recommended as an effective UV protectant.\n\nTo help further their corporate philosophy, several years ago Wallaroo started a Sun Protection Commitment campaign. Every year Wallaroo donates 1% of its profits to different organizations that undertake skin cancer research, prevention and education in the United States. Additionally, over the last 19 years, Wallaroo has made both financial and product donations to organizations such as the Melanoma Research Foundation, The Skin Cancer Research Foundation, The Colorado Melanoma Foundation and also participated in various events including Mallets for Melanoma, Miles for Melanoma among others.","market":"Developed","industry":"Apparel","sector":"Wholesale/Retail","operatingCountry":"United

Wallaroo prides itself on being a leader in the fashion-forward, sun protective hat industry, combining the latest fabrics and designs with maximum sun protection. Many of the hats in the Wallaroo Collection are rated UPF 50+ ensuring that the customer gets a 97.5% UV block from the sun's harmful rays. With the incidence of skin cancer on the rise nationally, sun protection is more important now than ever before. Wallaroo is actively involved with the Skin Cancer Foundation and many Wallaroo hats are recommended as an effective UV protectant.\n\nTo help further their corporate philosophy, several years ago Wallaroo started a Sun Protection Commitment campaign. Every year Wallaroo donates 1% of its profits to different organizations that undertake skin cancer research, prevention and education in the United States. Additionally, over the last 19 years, Wallaroo has made both financial and product donations to organizations such as the Melanoma Research Foundation, The Skin Cancer Research Foundation, The Colorado Melanoma Foundation and also participated in various events including Mallets for Melanoma, Miles for Melanoma among others.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Apparel","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"80301","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"sun hat, sun protection, UPF 50+, UPF 50+ sun protective hats, protect your skin, take care of your skin, skin cancer protection, sun hat for women, sunhats for women,","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"China","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1415836800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"81.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Boulder","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"80301","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CO","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Boulder","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"74d12103-ee85-5d51-b8e2-b439c6006b1c","name":"Walden Local Meat","slug":"walden-local-meat","description":"Together with farm partners, Walden Local Meat markets and distributes sustainable meat that you can truly feel good about - from a health, economic, environmental and ethical perspective.\n \n Walden began from a shared belief in linking our land to our food.
