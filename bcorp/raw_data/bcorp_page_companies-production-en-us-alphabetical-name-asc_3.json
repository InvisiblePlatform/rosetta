London and New York. They aim to generate attractive risk-adjusted financial returns for our investors alongside measurable positive social and/or environmental impact. Founded in 2002, Bridges has since raised over $1bn of investor capital across its platform of Sustainable Growth, Property and Social Sector Funds. \n\nBridges invests in business, properties, social enterprises and outcomes contracts that help to address pressing long-term social and environmental challenges, with a focus on four key impact themes: health & well-being, education & skills, sustainable living and underserved markets. Their strategy is to focus on opportunities where growth and impact go hand-in-hand; that is, where achieving important social and environmental goals also drives better performance. This could be by backing businesses that generate jobs in areas of high unemployment, building environmentally-friendly care homes for the elderly to sustain our ageing population, or providing flexible financing for innovative youth employment programmes.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -

They match volunteers and organizations based on a variety of characteristics including skills, cause interests, and time availability.\n \nThey help organizations identify their needs as short-term, discrete, and individual-based projects. Their projects are structured in this way to make it easy for professionals to find time to volunteer in the midst of their busy daily lives. They charge nonprofits and social enterprises less than 5% of the cost that they would normally pay for the professional services our volunteers provide. Their service is free for all professionals willing to donate their time. They also help corporations offer their skills-based volunteer opportunities for their employees.\n \nCatchafire's mission is to provide talented individuals with meaningful pro bono experiences in order to build capacity for social good organizations. They believe that all social good organizations should have access to top talent, that all people should have the opportunity to use their talents for good, and that people should have the opportunity to be transformed by a positive volunteer experience.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Web portals","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"10016","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"online marketplace volunteer matching charity community service non-profit Professional Skills-based Pro Bono Probono Nonprofit Rachael Chong New York city nyc Accounting Finance Design Marketing Multimedia catch fire experience connect match","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1270080000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"97.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"10016","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"DE","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"4e301198-399b-5362-9ab7-c042b4f94bcb","name":"Cathexis Consulting Inc","slug":"cathexis-consulting-inc","description":"Cathexis is a full-service, independent evaluation firm, providing expert, client-focused evaluations that help organizations and their programs measure success and make change for the better.

Learning lessons from the private sector to benefit not-for-profit organisations, since set up in May 2009, Cause4 has raised over £46 million for clients, and is committed to helping attract the best graduate talent to work on some of the world’s most pressing issues.\n \nCause4 wants charities and social enterprises to become more business-minded; and businesses and corporate leaders to become more socially-minded. They believe that if these two sectors can meet in the middle, then everyone will see the greatest possible innovation in addressing issues of social need and challenge, allowing for huge impact in addressing some of the most intractable social problems in the world today, at a global and local level.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Management consultant -

Additionally, ChicoBag is working hard to significantly reduce waste in the school fundraising and promotional products industries which are needlessly flooded with unhealthy or cheaply made throwaway products. ChicoBag co-brands their bags and a curated collection of quality reusables for organizations, businesses and schools who share their mission, value quality products, & want to keep their brand or message out of the trash.\n \nChicoBag’s culture thrives on zero-waste. Office waste is weighed and tabulated monthly. Compost is processed by a flock of company chickens. The company has a take-back program that accepts all types of bags from the public, functional or not. They also work with food banks to redistribute the functional bags to those in need and find organizations who can repurpose the others into useful products such as woven rugs. ChicoBag will continue to innovate, challenge the status-quo, and provide the world with ideas and products that help make bagging the single-use habit

Additionally, ChicoBag is working hard to significantly reduce waste in the school fundraising and promotional products industries which are needlessly flooded with unhealthy or cheaply made throwaway products. ChicoBag co-brands their bags and a curated collection of quality reusables for organizations, businesses and schools who share their mission, value quality products, & want to keep their brand or message out of the trash.\n \nChicoBag’s culture thrives on zero-waste. Office waste is weighed and tabulated monthly. Compost is processed by a flock of company chickens. The company has a take-back program that accepts all types of bags from the public, functional or not. They also work with food banks to redistribute the functional bags to those in need and find organizations who can repurpose the others into useful products such as woven rugs. ChicoBag will continue to innovate, challenge the status-quo, and provide the world with ideas and products that help make bagging the single-use habit easy.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other/general wholesale trade","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"95973","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"reusable bags, reusable bottles, waste free lunch, snack bags, tote bags, custom bags, custom, promotional products, fundraising, school fundraising","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1380758400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"128.3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Chico","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"95973","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Chico","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"5cc74cc9-82e4-524c-8f12-210df96ca67d","name":"Chicory Wealth","slug":"chicory-wealth","description":"Chicory Wealth is a fee-only Registered Investment Advisory practice providing holistic Financial Life Planning services to individuals and nonprofit organizations across the country.
