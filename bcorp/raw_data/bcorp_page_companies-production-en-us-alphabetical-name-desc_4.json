SQUIZ has proven that it's possible to make consumer products locally and profitably. Since their commercial launch, SQUIZ has prevented the creation of over 50 tons of non-recyclable consumer waste through the use of their reusable pouches.\n\n Beginning in the prototype stage, the founders carefully considered the impact of their products in terms of environmental health and the social role of the company they wanted to create. The question was not only: ÒHow would this benefit the company?Ó but especially: ÒWhat benefit could the company bring to others?Ó With strong values deeply rooted in sustainable development as well as social responsibility, SQUIZ seeks to provide ethical products for all ages, to support charitable projects, and to be a driving force in the reduction of household waste.","market":"Developed -

Spring Bank has been designated by the US Treasury as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), in recognition of the investments and loans the bank makes in low and moderate income communities in New York City. Spring Bank is also a preferred lender with the US Small Business Administration (SBA).\n \n Spring Bank's mission is to pursue a double bottom line of providing returns to its shareholders and serving the needs of underserved consumers and small businesses in the New York City area. In neighborhoods where the use of high-cost fringe financial products is more the norm than the exception, the bank has created innovative depository and loan products designed to help unbanked and underbanked consumers avoid getting trapped in cycles of debt and build wealth. In addition the bank attempts to serve the needs of the small businesses that create wealth and jobs for residents of the New York City area.","market":"Developed","industry":"Deposit bank - Developed

Where, when we clear away the junk – in our food and in our minds – we allow the opportunity to create sublime moments, whether it’s with a dish, a person, or a business idea.\n\nFounded by a mother who always made her own salad dressing because she couldn’t find one with ingredients she liked, Sophia Maroon saw an opportunity to upgrade what was on offer in the salad dressing aisle. Dress It Up Dressing uses simple formulas to create sublime flavors and memorable dishes.\n\nHowever, they don't just want our product to taste good, they want it to do good. Early on, Dress It Up Dressing made a commitment to produce their dressings responsibly and sustainably. That means working with schools to promote healthy eating, minimizing their effect on the environment, and providing opportunities for people in their community.\n\nAs a Certified B Corporation, they measure their success by more than just dollars.

SnappCar aims to remove 5 out of 10 cars from our streets in the markets that we are active in.\n \nDid you know that the average car stands still for 23 hours each and every day? And there are 250 million cars in Europe alone. Just imagine all the space taken up by these idle chunks of metal. Insane, isnÕt it?\nSnappCar is a fully reliable and user-friendly marketplace, riding the wave of Collaborative Consumption. SnappCar provides an all-risk insurance, handles the payment and resolves any issue that may arise during the rental period to make the user experience as smooth as possible. As a result everybody benefits. Less cars are needed which frees up precious space in cities and reduces CO2 emissions. Car owners save on their monthly cost, while renters save money by avoiding more expensive alternatives.

Within its community thousands of car owners share their personal cars with tens of thousands of neighbors and friends, all of those looking for a more social, durable and cheaper alternative. SnappCar aims to remove 5 out of 10 cars from our streets in the markets that we are active in.\n \nDid you know that the average car stands still for 23 hours each and every day? And there are 250 million cars in Europe alone. Just imagine all the space taken up by these idle chunks of metal. Insane, isnÕt it?\nSnappCar is a fully reliable and user-friendly marketplace, riding the wave of Collaborative Consumption. SnappCar provides an all-risk insurance, handles the payment and resolves any issue that may arise during the rental period to make the user experience as smooth as possible. As a result everybody benefits. Less cars are needed which frees up precious space in cities and reduces CO2 emissions. Car owners save on their monthly cost, while renters save money by avoiding more expensive alternatives. Finally, it also increases the social cohesion in neighborhoods as people get to know their neighbors.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Transportation support","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"3521 AL","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"SnappCar, Carsharing, Peer 2 peer, p2p, Cars, Europe, Collaborative consumption, sharing economy","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Sweden","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1425254400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"82.3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Utrecht","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Utrecht","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"3521 AL","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Berlin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Södermanland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Utrecht","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"utrecht","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Berlin","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Stockholm","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Utrecht","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"59e9d119-471c-5eb4-adce-102fe1f451c1","name":"Snaplinc Consulting LLC","slug":"snaplinc-consulting-llc","description":"WHAT THEY DO - They support a broad range of activities throughout the product creation, production, sourcing and fulfillment lifecycle with a focus on best practices tools including Higg Index suite of tools, the B Impact Assessment and more.\n\nWHO THEY SERVE - Apparel and consumer product companies looking for experienced insights and support as they grow.

It is through this ethos that they seek ethical business partnerships and alliances with suppliers who share their values. They source products of the highest quality naturally derived ingredients of which between 86-97% are biodegradable. They are carbon negative and recycle 97% of salon waste, including hair cuttings to make containment booms which clean up oil spills in our oceans. \n\nTheir overall mission is to empower women, strengthen community, and to use beauty as a force for good.
