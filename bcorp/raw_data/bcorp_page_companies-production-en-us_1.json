Their projects are structured in this way to make it easy for professionals to find time to volunteer in the midst of their busy daily lives. They charge nonprofits and social enterprises less than 5% of the cost that they would normally pay for the professional services our volunteers provide. Their service is free for all professionals willing to donate their time. They also help corporations offer their skills-based volunteer opportunities for their employees.\n \nCatchafire's mission is to provide talented individuals with meaningful pro bono experiences in order to build capacity for social good organizations. They believe that all social good organizations should have access to top talent, that all people should have the opportunity to use their talents for good, and that people should have the opportunity to be transformed by a positive volunteer experience.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Web portals","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"10016","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"online marketplace volunteer matching charity community service non-profit Professional Skills-based Pro Bono Probono Nonprofit Rachael Chong New York city nyc Accounting Finance Design Marketing Multimedia catch fire experience connect match","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1270080000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"97.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"10016","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"DE","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"9ce6a347-edb2-5df7-baad-9854680692e7","name":"The Owners Collective","slug":"the-owners-collective","description":"Owners Collective is training and mentoring company that helps build conscious, connected and expanded brands.

We have grown to one of the largest independent coaching and leadership firms globally, providing solutions across every continent except Antarctica! The shift in the landscape for leaders has been dramatic. As the expectations of leaders has increased, so too has the challenge to attract talent and build a genuinely inclusive environment. We partner with our clients to help them deliver results. We are obsessed with innovation and our clients and understand the dynamic between people’s performance and the complexity of the business context. Whether we are coaching individuals, groups, or leadership teams, we provide pragmatic challenge and insights that enable individuals to thrive and grow. We bring out the best in leaders, so they build better, more productive teams, focusing on the potential of leading inclusively to engage and motivate teams.  In addition to supporting leaders and managers, we work with parents, female talent and culturally and ethnically diverse employees.

They have over 40 self-catering houses (and growing). Each is presented with something special and quirky enough to tempt people away from flying and into staycations. Under 45% of holiday houses are accepted into the business. \n\nThe brand focuses on redefining 'luxury' away from 1980's ideals and into a modern, integral meaning, including the basics: local, and seasonal. Inspiring 'education touch-points' are crafted into all communications to encourage people into future-focused, climate-friendly behaviours. \nOwners are encouraged to green-up their houses and support local businesses. Guests are encouraged to immerse themselves in the slow/local life, embrace nature, and support sustainability-goals on their travels. The brand gives particular emphasis to inspiring people through story-telling; interviewing local food heroes and spending-green. \n\nThe directors believe that the business is an effective platform to catalyse and lead change, and often the first to roll their sleeves up and get involved. Our future vision is collaborative, upbeat and positive.

Lara began practicing IP law in 1999. After reading Yvon Choiunard's book, \"Let My People Go Surfing\" in December, 2005, Lara became one of the first few hundred members of 1% for the Planet in January, 2006. By June, 2006 Lara joined the Board of Directors of 1% and by February, 2008 The Law Office of Lara Pearson became one of the world’s first Certified B Corporations. Yay!\n \nLara’s deep involvement in the social enterprise community enables her to see things other attorneys miss, providing immeasurable value to her clients. For example, Lara once identified infringement on one of her client’s marks and got the infringer to switch brands (cease and desist) before her client even knew of the infringement.\n \nLara is exceptionally skilled at making intellectual property (IP) law easy and fun. She has a real knack for conveying her knowledge in an engaging and entertaining way that makes complex subject matter not only simple and understandable, but also enjoyable.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Legal activities","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"89451","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"law firm, brand protection, intellectual property, IP, trademarks, law, CSR, corporate social responsibility, lara pearson, legal, trademark law, trademark rights, IP protection, intangible property, IP assets, Nevada, soulfulpreneurship, cannabis law","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1202947200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"95.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Nevada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Incline Village","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"89451","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"NV","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Nevada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Incline Village","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"c578203c-0122-5485-82d9-6b401b2649ad","name":"PT Sukkha Citta Indonesia","slug":"p-t-sukkha-citta-indonesia","description":"SukkhaCitta is an award-winning social enterprise that works to end the exploitation of women while protecting the planet.
