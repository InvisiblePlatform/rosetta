In 1988 Pam & Martin Brook purchased the property, which was a cleared, run-down dairy farm. The Brook family set about planting 4,500 macadamia trees and 40,000 native rainforest plants.

The KAIBAE Wellness retail line works to “rewild” the microbiome inside and out, taking it back to its original state of resilience, replenishing what is lost living the modern life, which is increasingly disconnected from what nature provides.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Personal care products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"93101","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"baobab, baobab fruit powder, baobab oil, baobab tea, prebiotic, polyphenols, superfood, biodiversity, microbiome wellness, gut health, skin health, rewilding, rewild, regenerative agroforestry, green beauty, clean beauty,","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1645488000000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"80.4","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Santa Barbara","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"93101","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"California","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Santa Barbara","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"7a33ceb2-d2a0-540f-a067-6bc0c66f025e","name":"Monarc Jewellery Limited","slug":"monarc-jewellery-limited","description":"Monarc Jewellery is based in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, founded by Ella Drake in 2017.

It started with two aspiring designers (Ho&Mulder) feeling responsibility for the impact of the things they brought into the world. When they graduated from the Artez Academy of the Arts they felt a disconnect between the inner workings of the fashion industry and the way they wanted to operate. Together they started working on bringing design, fashion and honesty together.\n\nBoth operational in the B2C and B2B market, Team Fraenck upcycles and recycles as many (textile) materials they can get their hands on.

Backed by its Fileni, Fileni Bio, Sempre Domenica and Club dei Galli signature brands and a widespread structure in the large-scale retail, normal trade and Ho.re.ca distribution channels, Fileni is one of the biggest Italian player in this industry. In addition to Italy, Fileni sells in over 30 countries abroad, 90% of which in Europe. Fileni's supply chain starts from the fields where raw materials for feeding animals are grown, goes all the way through hundreds of traditional and organic breeding farms mainly located in Central Italy and ends up on the dishes of Italian families. Innovation, quality, animal welfare and environmental sustainability are Fileni’s trademarks: since 1989 it has been making ready-to-eat products in a dedicated plant, in 2001 the organic production was launched and it has been providing its stakeholders with a proper sustainability report as of 2018.

From its Cingoli headquarters, in the province of Macerata, it has been running business since 1978. Backed by its Fileni, Fileni Bio, Sempre Domenica and Club dei Galli signature brands and a widespread structure in the large-scale retail, normal trade and Ho.re.ca distribution channels, Fileni is one of the biggest Italian player in this industry. In addition to Italy, Fileni sells in over 30 countries abroad, 90% of which in Europe. Fileni's supply chain starts from the fields where raw materials for feeding animals are grown, goes all the way through hundreds of traditional and organic breeding farms mainly located in Central Italy and ends up on the dishes of Italian families. Innovation, quality, animal welfare and environmental sustainability are Fileni’s trademarks: since 1989 it has been making ready-to-eat products in a dedicated plant, in 2001 the organic production was launched and it has been providing its stakeholders with a proper sustainability report as of 2018.
