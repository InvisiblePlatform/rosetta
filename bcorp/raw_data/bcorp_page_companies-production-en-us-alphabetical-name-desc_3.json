purchased.\n\ntentree was founded on the premise that every consumer wants to know that they are contributing to the wellbeing of our planet. They believe that they can inspire a new group of consumers to tackle the environmental issues we are now faced with head on, positively impacting our future. They work with a variety of not-for-profits, educational groups, and organizations across the globe to ensure that their planting efforts are having a real, marked impact in the local communities. To date, they have already planted over 25 million trees and have a goal to plant 1 billion trees by 2030.\n\nWith millions of trees planted to date, the impact is easy to see. These trees have provided hundreds of thousands of days of employment in underprivileged communities across the globe which equates to several hundred full-time jobs. Not to mention the countless hours of education that have gone into making these projects a success. The environmental impact is truly astounding as these trees help rejuvenate damaged eco-systems and remove pollution from the atmosphere. With every purchase this impact grows.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed -

Each year Lancaster City invites approx. 700 of these dear folks to get re-established in new homes. In addition to the turbulent and often-traumatic path to come to the United States, many refugees face a difficult time finding employment once they are resettled in Lancaster due to language and cultural barriers.\n \n The Stroopie Co., was founded with the goal of producing top notch Stroopies, while make a difference to the refugee population that is resettling in Lancaster.\n \n So what is a Stroopie? A Stroopie is a Dutch stroopwafel. It is a cinnamon cookie, made with a waffle iron with a layer of homemade caramel in the inside.
