We're creating positive changes to the way we consume food by replacing single use plastics with all natural, sustainably sourced, eco friendly and regenerative products. Our values of health, sustainability and community are an important part of everything that we do and the best part, they were inspired by you. By creating products with purpose, we are able to do well by doing good for both people and the planet. Our range of all natural products includes Coconut Bowls (3 sizes), Bamboo Cups,Wooden Cutlery, Coconut Candles, Plant Based Cookbooks, Zero Waste Market Bags and more.\n\nWe reimagined the waste streams of the coconut tree and realised it’s one of the most sustainable plants on the planet.
