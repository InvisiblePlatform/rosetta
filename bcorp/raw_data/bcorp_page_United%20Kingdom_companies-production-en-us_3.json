Squeaky enables corporate businesses and public sector organisations to buy 100% clean energy from UK-based solar, wind and hydro generators in an efficient, cost-effective way using a unique combination of expertise, software and contracts. \n\nWith increasing pressure to reduce emissions and work towards net zero, securing long-term supply of genuinely clean energy and avoiding greenwashing is of critical importance to organisations. Squeaky is here to help and offers an end-to-end service. \n\nContrary to popular belief, renewable energy does not always mean energy that is clean or carbon-neutral. Many energy companies, and indeed governments, include burning biomass in their definitions of ‘renewable’; a practice which is extremely harmful to the environment. All the energy on our platform is not just renewable; it’s Squeaky clean. \n\nThe team behind Squeaky, led by founder and MD Chris Bowden, have been at the forefront of innovation in the clean energy industry for many years. Squeaky is on a mission to accelerate the UK’s transition to 100% clean energy.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Other renewable energy installation","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Service with Minor Environmental Footprint","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"W1F 8WE","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Squeaky, Squeaky Clean Energy, Squeaky Clean, Squeaky Energy, Business energy, Commercial energy, energy, green energy, clean energy, renewable energy, renewables, solar, sustainable energy, local energy, B2B, Power Purchase Agreements, PPA, CPPA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1526428800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"86.8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"City of London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"W1F 8WE","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"City of London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"d410aa59-07ae-5fdf-b029-cce9ad1ece9a","name":"The Social Change Agency","slug":"the-social-change-agency","description":"The Social Change Agency delivers strategic consulting, providing the methods and tools to develop and deliver systemic change.

The ambition is rooted in the firm belief that fermented dairy products like yogurt contribute to a healthy diet by providing essential nutrients as well as the enjoyment of pleasurable taste and textures.\n\nThe first Danone yogurt was created by Isaac Carasso in 1919 in Barcelona, which gave rise to the first factory in the world to produce yogurt for general consumption. Fast forward to 1988 and the first Activia yoghurt was sold in the UK.\n\nIn the UK, Danone seeks to help consumers understand the role the fresh dairy products can play in a balanced diet, offering tasty, versatile choices to meet consumer’s needs every day. To achieve this, Danone works collaboratively with their employees, their partners and suppliers, and their local communities.\n\nDanone is now the 2nd biggest player in the UK market, with 4 well-known brands. And they continue to innovate; in 2016 Danone’s new 0% fat, 0% added sugar brand Light & Free was the largest dairy innovation in the UK.About Danone Company\n\nDedicated to bringing health through food to as many people as possible, Danone is a leading global food company built on four business lines: Fresh Dairy & Plant-based Products, Early Life Nutrition, Waters and Medical Nutrition. Through its mission and dual commitment to business success and social progress, the company aims to build a healthier future.\n\nThis is underlined by Danone’s new One Planet One Health signature, which demonstrates a commitment to inspire healthier eating and drinking habits, for all its stakeholders—its 100,000 employees, consumers, customers, suppliers, shareholders and all the communities with which it engages.\n\nDanone and B Lab announced in December 2015 an open source partnership and the ambition to become of the first multi-national certified as B Corp globally. Danone Dairy UK is the 5th Danone subsidiary to become certified.\n\nOur B Corp Certification is in line with our long-lasting commitment to economic success and social progress.

UK","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"description":{"value":"For almost 100 years, Danone, has sought to bring fermented dairy products to as many people as possible around the world. The ambition is rooted in the firm belief that fermented dairy products like yogurt contribute to a healthy diet by providing essential nutrients as well as the enjoyment of pleasurable taste and textures.\n\nThe first Danone yogurt was created by Isaac Carasso in 1919 in Barcelona, which gave rise to the first factory in the world to produce yogurt for general consumption. Fast forward to 1988 and the first Activia yoghurt was sold in the UK.\n\nIn the UK, Danone seeks to help consumers understand the role the fresh dairy products can play in a balanced diet, offering tasty, versatile choices to meet consumer’s needs every day. To achieve this, Danone works collaboratively with their employees, their partners and suppliers, and their local communities.\n\nDanone is now the 2nd biggest player in the UK market, with 4 well-known brands. And they continue to innovate; in 2016 Danone’s new 0% fat, 0% added sugar brand Light & Free was the largest dairy innovation in the UK.About Danone Company\n\nDedicated to bringing health through food to as many people as possible, Danone is a leading global food company built on four business lines: Fresh Dairy & Plant-based Products, Early Life Nutrition, Waters and Medical Nutrition. Through its mission and dual commitment to business success and social progress, the company aims to build a healthier future.\n\nThis is underlined by Danone’s new One Planet One Health signature, which demonstrates a commitment to inspire healthier eating and drinking habits, for all its stakeholders—its 100,000 employees, consumers, customers, suppliers, shareholders and all the communities with which it engages.\n\nDanone and B Lab announced in December 2015 an open source partnership and the ambition to become of the first multi-national certified as B Corp globally. Danone Dairy UK is the 5th Danone subsidiary to become certified.\n\nOur B Corp Certification is in line with our long-lasting commitment to economic success and social progress. We are proud to join the B Corp movement where the collective action across multiple industries can make the change that is best for the planet and the communities we live and work in.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"W4 5YG","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Danone, B Corp, Danone Dairies UK, Craig Read, multi-national, One Planet One Health","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1513555200000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"86.2","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"W4 5YG","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"not listed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"d24f8930-3e02-56fa-8c58-092103798b9a","name":"Healthy Nibbles","slug":"healthy-nibbles","description":"Healthy Nibbles is on a mission to make choosing wellness a whole lot easier for busy, health-conscious people and organisations everywhere.
