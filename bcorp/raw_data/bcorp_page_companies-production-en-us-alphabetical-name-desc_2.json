herbal tea company. With the goal of reviving herbalism in North America, they traveled to the source of medicinal plants—often in remote, rural areas. On their travels, they were shocked to discover the poor social, living and working conditions of the mostly indigenous and impoverished herb farmers and wild collectors.\n\nFollowing the principles of right livelihood, the company pioneered a new ethical sourcing model by promoting organic agriculture, developing long-term equitable and fair trading relationships, and investing in these sourcing communities.\n\nOver four decades later, their teas are still formulated by herbalists, sourced responsibly and tested for quality by plant scientists. Their purposeful mission continues through your conscious choice to support Traditional Medicinals. Hoping to empower consumers to take responsibility for their own health, Traditional Medicinals believes in creating the highest quality products by considering every step of the process from their farms to your pantry, from sustainability and responsible sourcing, to social business practices. Plant Power for a Better You® isn’t just a tagline—it’s our mission.","market":"Developed","industry":"Beverages","sector":"Manufacturing","operatingCountry":"United

medicinal herbal tea company. With the goal of reviving herbalism in North America, they traveled to the source of medicinal plants—often in remote, rural areas. On their travels, they were shocked to discover the poor social, living and working conditions of the mostly indigenous and impoverished herb farmers and wild collectors.\n\nFollowing the principles of right livelihood, the company pioneered a new ethical sourcing model by promoting organic agriculture, developing long-term equitable and fair trading relationships, and investing in these sourcing communities.\n\nOver four decades later, their teas are still formulated by herbalists, sourced responsibly and tested for quality by plant scientists. Their purposeful mission continues through your conscious choice to support Traditional Medicinals. Hoping to empower consumers to take responsibility for their own health, Traditional Medicinals believes in creating the highest quality products by considering every step of the process from their farms to your pantry, from sustainability and responsible sourcing, to social business practices.

Tony's exists to make 100% slave free the norm in chocolate. Not just their own chocolate, but all chocolate worldwide. Because the system is broken and it’s up to chocolate companies to fix it. And the only way to make this happen is by working together. \nTony's raises awareness around child labour and forced labour in cocoa, because for change to happen, everyone has to be aware of current problems, possible solutions and the role we each play.\nTony's leads by example by being 100% traceable from bean-to-bar, because knowing who produces the beans where and under which circumstances is the only way to take full responsibility. Tony's also pays a higher cocoa price that enables cocoa farmers to earn a living. By investing in long-term partnerships and working directly with cocoa cooperatives, as well as working on quality and productivity together with the farmers, Tony's aims to make cocoa farming structurally more sustainable.\nTony's Chocolonely shows that it is possible to make chocolate differently and inspires other to do the same.","market":"Developed - Global","industry":"Food

Tony's exists to make 100% slave free the norm in chocolate. Not just their own chocolate, but all chocolate worldwide. Because the system is broken and it’s up to chocolate companies to fix it. And the only way to make this happen is by working together. \nTony's raises awareness around child labour and forced labour in cocoa, because for change to happen, everyone has to be aware of current problems, possible solutions and the role we each play.\nTony's leads by example by being 100% traceable from bean-to-bar, because knowing who produces the beans where and under which circumstances is the only way to take full responsibility. Tony's also pays a higher cocoa price that enables cocoa farmers to earn a living. By investing in long-term partnerships and working directly with cocoa cooperatives, as well as working on quality and productivity together with the farmers, Tony's aims to make cocoa farming structurally more sustainable.\nTony's Chocolonely shows that it is possible to make chocolate differently and inspires other to do the same.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"1014DA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Tony's, Tony's Chocolonely, chocolate, slave free, serious, crazy, 100% slave free, tasty, west africa, ghana, ivory coast, modern slavery, fair, Teun, cocoa","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Austria","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Belgium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ghana","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1387756800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"125.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Noord-Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"1014DA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Hamburg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Noord Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Noord-Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Amsterdam ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Hamburg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York City ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"686740cc-f863-5635-8378-5288f9fe012f","name":"Tonka SA","slug":"tonka-sa","description":"Tonka SA is a family owned company with 80 employees.

TOMbag created the world’s first fully circular solution for waste disposal: their reusable garbage bags are made out of post-consumer waste using GRS certified recycled plastic and can be fully upcycled at the end of their life. TOMbag reusable garbage bags are designed to last, are easily washable and 100% waterproof. They can be used for all kinds of waste and occasions (general waste, recyclables and even compost - at home and at such occasions as camping). TOMbag also works with businesses providing them with different sizes of reusable garbage bags including custom-made solutions. TOMbag is committed to donate at least 3% of its revenues to charitable partners with an environmental focus.
