First sold as greeting cards in specialty retail markets, Bloomin paper has grown into a extensive line of promotional products, retail stationary gifts, direct marketing solutions, and wedding invitations.\n \nBased in Boulder, Colorado, an eco-minded community, Bloomin embraced this attitude from the start. They continue to add alternative energy and eco-technologies as they grow, and they have always manufactured the most Earth-friendly printed marketing medium available. Their seed paper is crafted from 100% post-industrial, recycled paper and dyed with all-natural, vegetable-based pigments. Their products are printed with water-based inks and, when included, use corn-based packaging. Their production facility is now powered by a 30kW solar power system—enough for all of our energy needs and then some.","market":"Developed","industry":"Paper & paper

They continue to add alternative energy and eco-technologies as they grow, and they have always manufactured the most Earth-friendly printed marketing medium available. Their seed paper is crafted from 100% post-industrial, recycled paper and dyed with all-natural, vegetable-based pigments. Their products are printed with water-based inks and, when included, use corn-based packaging. Their production facility is now powered by a 30kW solar power system—enough for all of our energy needs and then some.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Paper & paper products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"80301","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"earth friendly, sustainable, handmade, green, plantable seed paper, cards that grow, seed embedded paper. wildflower seed paper, herb seed paper. eco friendly, Earth day, sustainable promotions, bloomin, bcorp","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1453766400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"91.8","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Boulder","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"80301","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"CO","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Colorado","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Boulder","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"28350c52-f161-5679-ac5f-e87d73eedb4e","name":"Banque Bonhôte","slug":"banque-bonhte","description":"Avec son siège à Neuchâtel depuis plus de 200 ans et des succursales à Bienne, Berne, Zurich, Soleure, Lausanne et Genève, Bonhôte est une banque privée suisse active principalement dans la gestion de fortune.

On its slopes grow the grapes which make this wine. POLKURA means ÒYellow StoneÓ in the native Chilean Mapuche language, making reference to large amounts of yellow granite spread along the clay soils of the area. Decomposed granite imparts the wine minerality and elegance, whereas clay gives it body and structure. The moderate coastal climate adds spice and fruitiness, resulting in a fine, yet complex and full bodied wine with very good balance.","market":"Emerging","industry":"Agricultural

wine, based on the exciting Syrah grape variety. Marchigue, the western end of the Colchagua Valley in Chile was chosen as the ideal site, for it has shown enormous potential to produce this varietal.\n \nPOLKURA is the name of a little hill, located inside the vineyard. On its slopes grow the grapes which make this wine. POLKURA means ÒYellow StoneÓ in the native Chilean Mapuche language, making reference to large amounts of yellow granite spread along the clay soils of the area. Decomposed granite imparts the wine minerality and elegance, whereas clay gives it body and structure. The moderate coastal climate adds spice and fruitiness, resulting in a fine, yet complex and full bodied wine with very good balance.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Emerging","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Agricultural Processing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Agriculture/Growers","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"00000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"www.polkura.cl","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1450310400000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"91.7","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Chile","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Cardenal Caro","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Marchigue","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"00000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Cardenal Caro","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Marchigue","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"b791c52e-6815-5f66-9979-9d03566042f8","name":"Turn-Key Marketing & Promotions, Inc.","slug":"turn-key-marketing-promotions-inc","description":"Turn-Key is a mission-driven event marketing agency exclusively serving the Natural Products industry.

They were the first to bring the classic, European cotton string market bags to the US.\n \n They use third parties to certify that their supply chain and manufacturing meet or exceed international standards for materials and social conduct. All of the inks used in their custom printing are PVC and phthalate-free, their dyes are AZO free. They do these things not because they have to but because they're the right thing to do. They're very selective about whose merchandise they carry at ECOBAGS.com and they encourage all of their partnering manufacturers to comply with their high standards.\n \n Eco-Bags Products knows that there is no \"away\" in our throwaway society.

At Eco-Bags Products, they're innovators - they were one of the first to introduce reusable bags to the market in 1992. They were the first to bring the classic, European cotton string market bags to the US.\n \n They use third parties to certify that their supply chain and manufacturing meet or exceed international standards for materials and social conduct. All of the inks used in their custom printing are PVC and phthalate-free, their dyes are AZO free. They do these things not because they have to but because they're the right thing to do. They're very selective about whose merchandise they carry at ECOBAGS.com and they encourage all of their partnering manufacturers to comply with their high standards.\n \n Eco-Bags Products knows that there is no \"away\" in our throwaway society.

Headquartered in Lewiston, the Bank has been fiercely independent for 150 years offering innovative banking solutions to meet clients’ individual needs. Androscoggin Bank is Member FDIC.\n\nAndroscoggin Bank is part of a small number of banks nationally who share in their commitment to leverage business as a force of good in their world.

These stories are beautiful, singular and unexpected, having roots that travel much deeper than the mere circumstance of how two people met and fell in love. The jewelry that we give one another, the symbols of our unique love, isn’t just conjured from the ether. Most gems are dug out of the ground, and usually it’s a rather messy and ugly business that comes at great peril for the individuals doing the mining and for the environment. For this reason FTJCo believe it’s essential that every step a ring makes on its journey to you is accounted for.\n \nAll Fairtrade and Fairmined gold comes from small-scale and artisanal mines that take great pains to reduce their dependence on harmful chemicals. This is good news for the environment and for the people who live and mine in these communities. It’s not overstating things in the least to say that this gold changes the lives of those who mine it, and at FTJCo they want to make sure it’s for the better, not the worse.","market":"Developed -

These stories are beautiful, singular and unexpected, having roots that travel much deeper than the mere circumstance of how two people met and fell in love. The jewelry that we give one another, the symbols of our unique love, isn’t just conjured from the ether. Most gems are dug out of the ground, and usually it’s a rather messy and ugly business that comes at great peril for the individuals doing the mining and for the environment. For this reason FTJCo believe it’s essential that every step a ring makes on its journey to you is accounted for.\n \nAll Fairtrade and Fairmined gold comes from small-scale and artisanal mines that take great pains to reduce their dependence on harmful chemicals. This is good news for the environment and for the people who live and mine in these communities. It’s not overstating things in the least to say that this gold changes the lives of those who mine it, and at FTJCo they want to make sure it’s for the better, not the worse.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Jewelry & related articles","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Manufacturing","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"M4X1P3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1363305600000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"91.1","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Canada","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Ontario","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Toronto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"M4X1P3","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Ontario","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Toronto","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"f03b928f-fe31-5768-8906-178d5f701a43","name":"Tessi Consulting","slug":"tessi-consulting","description":"Tessi Consulting is a Boston based diversity firm focused on helping midsize US & global corporations on a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) journey.

From its Cingoli headquarters, in the province of Macerata, it has been running business since 1978. Backed by its Fileni, Fileni Bio, Sempre Domenica and Club dei Galli signature brands and a widespread structure in the large-scale retail, normal trade and Ho.re.ca distribution channels, Fileni is one of the biggest Italian player in this industry. In addition to Italy, Fileni sells in over 30 countries abroad, 90% of which in Europe.
