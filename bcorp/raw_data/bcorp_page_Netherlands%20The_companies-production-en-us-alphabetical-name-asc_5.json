TOMbag created the world’s first fully circular solution for waste disposal: their reusable garbage bags are made out of post-consumer waste using GRS certified recycled plastic and can be fully upcycled at the end of their life. TOMbag reusable garbage bags are designed to last, are easily washable and 100% waterproof. They can be used for all kinds of waste and occasions (general waste, recyclables and even compost - at home and at such occasions as camping). TOMbag also works with businesses providing them with different sizes of reusable garbage bags including custom-made solutions. TOMbag is committed to donate at least 3% of its revenues to charitable partners with an environmental focus. As a part of this commitment TOMbag plants a tree in Australia for each sale made via a partnership with One Tree Planted.

And the only way to make this happen is by working together. \nTony's raises awareness around child labour and forced labour in cocoa, because for change to happen, everyone has to be aware of current problems, possible solutions and the role we each play.\nTony's leads by example by being 100% traceable from bean-to-bar, because knowing who produces the beans where and under which circumstances is the only way to take full responsibility. Tony's also pays a higher cocoa price that enables cocoa farmers to earn a living. By investing in long-term partnerships and working directly with cocoa cooperatives, as well as working on quality and productivity together with the farmers, Tony's aims to make cocoa farming

Tony's exists to make 100% slave free the norm in chocolate. Not just their own chocolate, but all chocolate worldwide. Because the system is broken and it’s up to chocolate companies to fix it. And the only way to make this happen is by working together. \nTony's raises awareness around child labour and forced labour in cocoa, because for change to happen, everyone has to be aware of current problems, possible solutions and the role we each play.\nTony's leads by example by being 100% traceable from bean-to-bar, because knowing who produces the beans where and under which circumstances is the only way to take full responsibility. Tony's also pays a higher cocoa price that enables cocoa farmers to earn a living. By investing in long-term partnerships and working directly with cocoa cooperatives, as well as working on quality and productivity together with the farmers, Tony's aims to make cocoa farming structurally more sustainable.\nTony's Chocolonely shows that it is possible to make chocolate differently and inspires other to do the same.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"market":{"value":"Developed - Global","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"industry":{"value":"Food products","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"sector":{"value":"Wholesale/Retail","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"operatingPostalCode":{"value":"1014DA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"websiteKeywords":{"value":"Tony's, Tony's Chocolonely, chocolate, slave free, serious, crazy, 100% slave free, tasty, west africa, ghana, ivory coast, modern slavery, fair, Teun, cocoa","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"countries":[{"value":"Austria","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Belgium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Germany","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Ghana","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United Kingdom","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"United States","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"initialCertificationDateTimestamp":{"value":"1387756800000","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"latestVerifiedScore":{"value":"125.0","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCountry":{"value":"Netherlands The","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqProvince":{"value":"Noord-Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqCity":{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"hqPostalCode":{"value":"1014DA","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"provinces":[{"value":"Hamburg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Noord Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Noord-Holland","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}],"cities":[{"value":"Amsterdam","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Amsterdam ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"Hamburg","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"London","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},{"value":"New York City ","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}]}},{"__typename":"CertifiedCompanies","id":"9a3b305a-594c-568f-a13d-05aad62fffa5","name":"Too Good To Go ApS","slug":"too-good-to-go-ap-s","description":"One third of all food produced for human consumption never makes it to our plate, and this is massive problem for the planet.

But also women who need support in taking the next step in their career or social life, or in (re-)entering the job market. This is done through personal guidance in short-term programs aimed at lasting change. \nWith the Raap method, for each client the coach uses a combination of methods and techniques, sometimes including martial arts elements, to get results. If necessary, we involve other specialists or refer to other parties. Coaching takes place outdoor in nature as much as possible. This enables us get to the core faster and together establish concrete and achievable goals, such as an acceptable, workable situation, or the strength to get more out of life or career. \nAfterwards, the women can live their private, social or professional lives with a goal and a future perspective.
