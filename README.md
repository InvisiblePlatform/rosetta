# Invisible Rosetta

What's going on, but with everything. 

In this repo will be a collection of scripts, tools to bootstrap collecting 
data and build the frontend.

A lot of cleaning is still needed to get this runnable by others without assistance.
We lack documentation and consistancy due to an upcoming restructuring of the approach.
With a lot of history, unusued and redundant files.

Here be dragons.

## License?

We currently do not have a license on this repo while we transition to our new 
approach. It is planned to release under MIT.
